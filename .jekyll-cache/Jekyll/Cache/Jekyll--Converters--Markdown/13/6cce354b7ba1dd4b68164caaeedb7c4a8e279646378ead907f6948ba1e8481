There's an increasing trend to build websites using static site generators rather than adopt dynamic alternatives such as Wordpress, Squarespace or Webflow.

<div class="contenttext">
Why? Fundamentally there are a few reasons in my eyes:
</div>

<div class="contenttext">
1. Cost - A number of these solutions (e.g. Squarespace) can cost up to £150/£160 a year. 
</div>

<div class="contenttext">
2. Flexibility - You can customise the site to support features beyond what these solutions provide and have ultimately more control over the implementation.
