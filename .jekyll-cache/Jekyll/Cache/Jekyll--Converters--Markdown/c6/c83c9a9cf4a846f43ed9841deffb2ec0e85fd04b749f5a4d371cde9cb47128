All of my personal projects are explorations into everyday problems people face with no commercial angle as such.  If you’re interested in the commercial aspects of the applications, via:
<ul>
    <li>Purchase of a white-labelled product;</li>
    <li>Purchase of the rights, source code and apps or</li>
    <li>Collaboration on a project in the commercial space</li>
</ul>

then get in touch.

    I built out Click Treat with in the pet-tech space as a React Native app with Async Storage on Expo for @ Barketplace.  The main app functions as a digital pet “clicker trainer”, instructional videos and a trending view for understanding consistency and regularity of training.

            Both apps are experiments with the food-tech space to provide simple and ad-free access via two (currently) apps.  Both are built out on Firebase, Expo, React Native and Async Storage. Just Chop - a way to keep, detail and use personal recipes that you’ve collected over the years in handwritten form. Chop Shop - a way to collaborate with partners, friends or neighbours on shopping lists.  It provides a real-time shopping view which allows you to distribute the shopping effort with one or more people via real-time updates.

    It all begins with an idea. Loquacious is a simple word app to improve your vocabulary.  Built on Expo, React Native with SQLite as a backend.  Uses Python for Glue.
