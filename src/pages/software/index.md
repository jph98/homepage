#### Software Services

I'm a hands on CTO in terms of architecture, design and code with businesses.  I believe product management and software architecture and closely aligned and should involve technical leads as well as product managers designing software products.  I don't believe in the title architect - it's more a role someone plays on a project working with others as part of a cross-functional team to evolve products.

---

**Transformation** - I've carried out several reviews and produced proposals for companies around where they need to be with business/product and the underlying technology.  I've then worked to evolve the baseline architecture (what they have today) towards target architecture.  I've been through TOGAF enterprise architecture in depth through to solutions and technical arcchitecture.  

---
**Cloud Native Architecture** - Analysis of existing products for companies looking to transition to the cloud.  Planning of the transition, proposal of cloud native services for applications.  Advice on provisioning, deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, site reliability and performance.

---
**Data Architecture** - Review of existing systems, planning transitions to the cloud, building data pipelines and best practices for engineering around predictive analytics.  I've worked in adtech, drug modelling, eCommerce, finance, insurance with data lakes, data warehouses and complex data pipelines. This has involved reviewing agency built solutions, augmenting existing systems and producing greenfield architecture proposals also.

---
**Architecture Planning** - Baselining your existing architecture. Planning a target architecture and working out how to evolve to that architecture with teams.

---
**Architecture Training** - How design and architecture fits into teams, processes around design and architecture.  Mentoring for engineers on non-functional requirements, how to formalise those and how to ensure those requirements are met.

---
**Insourcing** - I've frequently reviewed software and products built by agencies (often on top of their own in-house framework) ready for insourcing to companies.  That's often coupled with building the team internally to evolve the product.

---
**Product Build Guidance** - Building a new product is hard, I often advise execs to use agencies to build out solutions, but with a set of guidelines around the build.  This often involves a fractional role sitting in the initial product discovery sessions and then breaking down, refining and producing user stories with the teams to ensure we're building the right product with the right amount of extensibility built in for future development.
