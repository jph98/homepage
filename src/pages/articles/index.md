### Presentations

I've spoken at many events/conferences/companies around a variety of different themes...

#### Application Architecture

I've generally worked with a wide range of architectural styles across B2B SaaS products, high-scale B2C products for web/mobile projects.  I've built several distributed systems/micro-services products with Java/Python/Javascript/PHP.

**Application Design for the Cloud** - http://tiny.cc/ef20ez
Presentation I gave in Cardiff on how to architect applications for the cloud, mostly AWS.

**The Role of the Architect** - https://www.slideshare.net/jph98/the-role-of-the-architect
Gave this presentation in Berlin at a meetup discussing the role of the architect in software teams (not the title).

**Software Estimation Workshop** - http://tiny.cc/3r20ez
A workshop I held internally at a company to improve the process of software estimates provided to the business.  Short story - use PERT, consider the whole

**SOLID Principles for Object Oriented Design** - http://tiny.cc/mt30ez
An internal talk on using SOLID for good OO design in applications.  Big proponent for clean code by Michael Feathers and many years dealing with hideous legacy systems.  There be dragons.

#### On Software Processes

I have lots of experience reviewing product and engineering processes for companies and techniques around software development.  I generally approach changes to these as experiments putting in appropriate change management processes.

**Debugging Software** - http://tiny.cc/5720ez
Internal talk I gave after reading the brilliant book Debug It by Paul Butcher.  Still use the techniques to this day.

**Refactoring** - http://tiny.cc/1h30ez
Internal workshop I ran on refactoring principles and techniques for software (Java and statically typed language focused).

**Jenkins and Continuous Integration** - http://tiny.cc/qj30ez
Internal talk on using Jenkins (old now) for continuous integration circa 2011.

#### On Hiring 

I have a popular hiring post on Linkedin, focused around some pretty dreary days in 
[Berlin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/berlin-jobs-some-hiring-advice-jonathan-holloway/)

#### On Data Engineering and Science

I've reviewed many data-intensive applications that utilise predictive analytics.  This ranges from drug-modelling applications to the review of data lakes and architectures for companies.  I've also been drafted in as a consultant to advise on specific data storage, pipeline and processing technology.

**An Overview of Data Pipelines** - http://tiny.cc/ww20ez
Presentation I gave at the South West JVM meetup on data pipelines of various descriptions (programmatic, configurable, visual).  This was before the days of Airflow, BEAM etc...

**Introduction to Hadoop** - http://tiny.cc/b120ez
An old introduction to Hadoop I gave at a company off the back of a big Hadoop project.  

**Hadoop and Pig** - http://tiny.cc/m830ez
A set of presentations I gave internally at a company who were looking to do more with big data processing (past the use of R as a language).  This was after a big Hadoop project for a PB sized product.

**MongoDB, MongoMapper and Ruby** - http://tiny.cc/lv30ez
On the use of (beautiful) Ruby, MongoMapper and MongoDB which I was using at the time to build an application performance framework tool.  Also used it to do performance and load testing for big drug discovery platforms.

#### On Java

I have deep experience of the JVM and associated languages (mostly Kotlin these days and have spoken at several events.

**Introduction to JVM languages and Phantom** - http://tiny.cc/fy20ez
Gave this at South West JVM on a little known language called Phantom and the general approach to using alternatives to Java on the JVM

**Spring Boot - An Introduction** - https://www.slideshare.net/jph98/spring-boot-an-introduction-59458065
OK.  Flask came first in Python and even then I picked up Apache CXF and Dropwizard before Spring Boot came on the scene.  Used it to build a whole bunch of micro-services for various companies (and learned lots in the process).  Still use it to this day, but only with Kotlin.  

#### Application Frameworks

In the past I've adopted and used an embarassing number of web frameworks across Java, PHP, Python, Ruby and Javascript.  I've also made use of various application frameworks for service-based applications.

**Snow, A Micro Web Framework** - http://tiny.cc/6m30ez
South West JVM talk I gave on a Java micro web framework called Snow.  This was after discovering Flask in the Python world a few years earlier and being blown away by the simplicty after coming from Java webapp land,.

**High Performance Webapps** - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17BLkO19PVNNagU5JpBlb1TKFD1TgEoqGR3eIAWTgXos/edit#slide=id.p
An overiew of high performance webapps which came from much tuning of Apache workers (MPM/prefork) in-line with Tomcat and Java backend services.  Learned a lot about Linux from this, but mostly irrelevant in the world of auto-scaling on AWS etc...

**Introduction to the Play Framework** - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tYh-YAotbk1jyEw3dGiKm0Hj7QbvV6k6m8yU_vrbiIY/edit#slide=id.gd0fde28c_098
An overview of the then trendy Play Framework before they moved to Scala and everybody hated it.  Shame.

**Lightweight Web Frameworks, Flask** - https://www.slideshare.net/jph98/lightweight-web-frameworks
An overview of lighweight web frameworks (when I fell in love in Flask) and the alternatives in different technology ecosystems.  

#### On Testing

I have a fair bit of understanding on application testability, the use of various tools for unit, integration, acceptance and performance testing and when to adopt mocking frameworks to simplify testing for applications and micro-service based architectures.

**Mockito, An Introduction** - http://tiny.cc/ro30ez
Internal talk I gave on a mocking framework called Mockito.  The principles still apply using things such as Mocha/Chai etc... today.

**What makes a good test?** - http://tiny.cc/3r30ez
The attributes of large, mid and small tests in applications.  Still applicable, people still getting it very wrong as well.  I see no tests, I see restrictive time-sucking useless test suites and aim for something in-between.

**A TDD Kata** - http://tiny.cc/nz30ez
A TDD kata I ran internally to improve our approach to test.  Not the biggest fan of TDD, bigger fan of good tests!

#### On Devops and Technology

I've spent a fair bit of time learning Linux system administration, provisioning, monitoring and performance technology.  

**Application Monitoring** - http://tiny.cc/o530ez
An overview of monitoring apps at various different levels.  Gave this internally at Brightpearl when I worked there.  

**Cloudinit/Userdata** - https://medium.com/@jonathan.holloway/simple-provisioning-of-ec2-instances-with-cloudinit-and-userdata-16b42edc512f
A super simple way to provision EC2 instances on AWS.  I was in a hurry at the time.  I'm def. a fan of Terraform these days.

**Database Migration with Flyway** - http://tiny.cc/e930ez
An overview of database migration after discovering an application that had been using Hibernate auto generated schema mappings.  Switched over to this after this.

**Apache Ivy** - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hHndCJMVQ95npgZx8rxdsT73UtULi0tSi2LUzTxWxaw/edit#slide=id.i5
Overview of Apache Ivy for dependency management.  Still prefer Maven massively and ended up writing all kinds of plugins around it at the time for a company hot on auditability in the pharma industry.

#### On Music

My side-projects and hobbies revolve around music, gaming and building simulations (think Conways Game of Life etc...).  I'm a big fan of Unity, Phaser and Pixi.js here as well as Sonic Pi, Ableton for algorave and programmatic music generation.

**MIDI and Java** - http://tiny.cc/9p30ez
Side project of mine at the time looking at visual manipulation of MIDI and external hardware synthesizers.

**Sonic Pi** - https://medium.com/@jonathan.holloway/sonic-pi-introduction-part-one-e2f12e9611df
First of a multi-part series on using Sonic Pi (and Ruby) for generating music.  This is very much towards the algorave scene which I discovered after this.

#### Misc

**Google Guava** - http://tiny.cc/7x30ez
Old presentation on the use of Guava in Java to cleanup applications and prevnt boilerplate code writing.

**General Purpose Languages (R, Python)** - http://tiny.cc/me40ez
An overview of general purpose language as an alternative to using R and Java at a company.  We setlled on Python, I ended up writing a lot of wrapper scripts around Perl Speaks NONMEM (PsN) at the time.  Good choice, was testable and better than hideous, hideous Bash scripts.  Watched in horror as someone wrote an early version of Chef, in Bash...
