#### Founder Help

Getting a startup off the ground is tough.  I've been fortunate enough to be in co-founder position on several occasions, some success, some failures.  I've seen lots of common problems with start-up/scale-up in their early, mid and late stages of development.  Some of these include:

* No market need for the product
* Not the right team
* Poor product
* Not using network/advisor

[Why startups fail?](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/307724)

This can be attributed to the challenges and problems faced by founders when building a startup, several of which are described here:

[Ten biggest challenges founders face](https://easternpeak.com/blog/the-10-biggest-challenges-startup-founders-face-when-building-a-tech-startup-team/)

So what can you do about it?  I'd highly recommend you read up on product management, development process and engineering over a few weekends.  Not only will you be more clued up on what it means, you'll be able to have better conversations around building products.

#### Product Management

A key part of this is the interface between product teams and their customers, but also between product/engineering.  There are a few models for structuring product/engineering, but I firmly believe that product/engineering should be one team in an organisation, because:

* The metrics by which they are measured are too closely aligned when delivering value to customers 
* Product owners need to sat within engineering teams and understand the day to day problems and be there to advise engineers - reducing the feedback loop

If you're a founder wanting to understand the foundations of product management more, I'd suggest reading the General Assembly book here:

#### Development Process

Another common problem involves a lack of understanding around development process.  Understanding this takes time, hiring a CTO early on is expensive.  A part-time, fractional CTO is a better way to do this.  Lean startup is a great overview of 

I often find the term cargo cult used when it comes down to process and technology.  I'll give you some examples

* Adopting the "Spotify Model"
* Doing "Agile" properly

You can read up on these, but the important part is that adopting a model from a company carte blanche is a recipe for disaster.  That model might have worked for their given size, constraints and product, but it doesn't mean it's going to work for you.  A great introduction to the development process is Accelerate
