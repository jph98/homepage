Things I’ve written for various bands, used as samples, instrumental backdrops.  Most of the projects I’ve done are guitar/string based in the band world.  I’ve written two soundtracks for short films with Soundforge, NI Massive and Absynth.  

Currently on the Ableton wagon and making heavy use of real-world synths (Moog and Korg), samples (Elektron Digitakt) and drum machines (TB-303, Electribes) and anything by Teenage Instruments.  VST/AU based instruments - fan of Serum, iZotope Iris, anything by Sugarbytes.
