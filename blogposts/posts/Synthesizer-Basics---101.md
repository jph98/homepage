What is a synthesizer? Essentially it’s something that generates audio signals. They became popular in the 1960’s, but originated much earlier than that.

  

#### Monophonic vs Polyphonic Definitions

*   Mono — one note at a time
*   Poly — many notes at a time

### Core Components

#### Oscillator 

Oscillators generate a sound wave in a given shape, based on timbre (distinctive quality) and harmonic complexity. Sound wave shapes can be one of:

*   Saw Waves
*   Triangle Waves
*   Pulse Waves

#### Filters

Removes certain frequencies from the sound. Few types:

*   Lo-pass filter — allow low frequency sounds to pass, reduce the higher
*   Hi-pass filter — allow high frequency sounds to pass, reduce the lower ones

#### Envelope (ADSR)

An envelope is defined as a time function.

There are two envelopes:

*   **Amplifier Envelope** — how the volume changes over time
*   **Filter Envelope** — how the cutoff frequency changes over time

and envelopes typically have four values:

*   **Attack** —time to fade-in the sound
*   **Decay** — time to fade-out the sound
*   **Sustain** — level it stays when key pressed
*   **Release** — time it takes to reduce to base level

Think about a given sound, it could be defined as one of these using the above controls:

*   Short Staccato (video) — quick
*   Violin Swells
*   Lush sustained pads
