Welcome to the start of the year. It’s busy.

Recruiters are picking up the phone to understand you as a company and your hiring needs. Recruiters are in-touch with candidates trying to place them and earn their fee. Do they really care about who they place where? Well they should do, at least until the rebate clause of the contract is out.

> How do you do hiring better?

Let’s look at some tips on how to hire better this year.

#### Compliance and Scoring Candidates

Ask the same questions, stick to a script and don’t deviate it from it

Decide on the criteria by which you’ll score candidates.

Decide on the structure of the interview and which questions you’ll ask and why. Ensure those questions are linked back to the appropriate scoring criteria.

#### On Recruitment Companies

Keep a list of recruitment companies and recruiters — good and bad! Remember the bad experiences you had with them.

Be aware of the introduction clause in a contract.

If somebody sends you an anonymous CV, Google parts of it, the candidate will often show up somewhere else.

Consider anonymous CV’s sent through a gift! Make sure you have this on the footer of your website!

#### Finally

Don’t be an asshole. Make candidates feel relaxed.
