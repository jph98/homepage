Much like we have technology enabled and technology first we’re in a similar position in the analytics world. We have data first companies (relying heavily analytics) and data-enabled companies — where data is a secondary thing.

Let’s look at a few examples of data companies:

*   **Insurance Startup** building a complex risk model for pet insurance;
*   **Fintech Startup** building an open banking offering for personal finance management relying on NLP for categorisation and transaction analysis;
*   **Data Analytics Consultancy** — providing data science and engineering services to companies in the financial sector to build out products.

#### Why Data is Not A Team

There’s a few things that are important to note here:

*   Data is an integral part of the company — both science and engineering;
*   You cannot do the data science without the engineering in many of these, unless that means a consultancy producing a presentation of ideas or a simple PDF report based on exploratory analysis.

All of these examples require that you build or productionise something. That means some of requirements, development, QA and operations workflow and aspects to consider.

In the context of this, it would be foolish to organise around the elements of the workflow itself and have teams for each step. That would create the following problems:

*   Overhead of resource management of the teams via un-necessary stupid spreadsheets with availability of the people in each team and careful co-ordination and juggling of multiple projects;
*   Homogenous thought and a tendency to shy away from learning;
*   Political and cultural problems.

So by these points I conclude that data is and cannot be an effective team in one of these organisations. It makes no sense. Data is integral to the company and integral to the team, so it should be part of a team not a team in itself.

What does that mean in terms of our team makeup? 

*   Full-stack or frontend/backend engineers;
*   Product Manager;
*   Data Scientist;
*   Data Engineer;
*   QA.

What do they organise around? As always — an outcome — possibly a project to deliver that outcome;

#### Product Manager or Data Scientist or both?

This is an interesting topic, but is much larger than this post. Product Managers are involved in product discovery as well as product development. That is an **exploratory** process where they try and figure out what the customer needs are using evaluative and generative research.

Let’s flip to the Data Scientist role and the process they go through isn’t that different. It’s exploratory, figuring out summary statistics and trying to derive some insight from the data. In the case of the insurance company above, this involved taking GB worth of data from BigQuery and doing the analysis. How did that data get into BigQuery? Well, for that they needed to rely heavily on the data-engineering function in the organisation to build the pipeline, co-analyse and clean the data and ingest it. 

#### Skills Gaps

Skills within a team in relation to data need to be broad. The biggest shortfall I see with data scientists during recruitment are the following:

*   Lack of understanding of database (yes, really) technology. Relational databases and knowledge of SQL are sadly missing. Less important, but still surprising is the lack of knowledge around non-relational (document, key-value, column-oriented) data stores;
*   Lack of skills around interactive visualisation. By and large this means Javascript and libraries for graphical display. 

The things I typically see missing from data-engineers are the following:

*     
    

#### Evaluating the Team — The Data Matrix

Let’s look at a very simple way of evaluating the team by means of a number of categories and self-scoring. Individuals should do this independently and then as part of a group.

Here’s the proposed areas:

### Conclusion

If you want to run this and benchmark it on a regular basis then get in-touch to discuss further.
