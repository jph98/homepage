Product and engineering teams in a company can be organised and led in different ways. The Chief Product Officer (CPO) and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) are vital roles here. In addition to this, there is a distinct difference between the product manager and the engineering mindset. We’re going to cover the following:

*   **Product & Engineering Structure** — how we compose product and engineering leadership within a team;
*   **Learning from each other** — how to improve the relationship by understanding and appreciating what both product and engineering do;
*   **Running a health-check** — so understand how well we function as a team.

### Product & Engineering Structure

There are a few options for the organisational structure in a company at the executive level for product and engineering:

*   **Combined** CTO/CPO — where a single person looks after both product and platform;
*   **Separate** CTO and CPO roles with the organisation with negotiation over what to build — platform or product items.

#### What do the CTO and CPO do?

Who does what? We can summarise CTO and CPO responsibilities as:

*   **CPO** — responsible for the strategy and why to build something to satisfy market needs. Creates the product roadmap. Innovates. Works on customer needs, challenges and opportunities. “**Defines what”.**
*   **CTO** — responsible for the application of technology in developing a product. The CTO creates the platform roadmap. **“Defines how”.**

A lot of people will have heard of the product roadmap, but the platform roadmap is something that can confuse. What does it contain?

*   **Technical Debt** — with priority, urgency and business-focused explanations of why this is important to address;
*   **Infrastructure Items** — items related to improving non-functional requirements such as monitoring, scalability, performance etc.…

At the point of prioritisation, features and platform items are then combined into a single stream for the coming year. It also prevents a single-view from becoming unwieldy.

Using this view, we’re hopefully heading towards a point where we can deliver a set of **features** that customers will buy and use to solve their problems, but also a platform that is consistently stable, highly performant and secure as a **platform**.

With regards to our combined or separate CTO/CPO discussion, this now has a bearing on prioritisation and the single view.

When we have separate people — CTO managing the platform roadmap and the CPO managing the product roadmap we have to discuss and negotiate what makes it into the coming year.

What percentage of product/platform is appropriate?

It depends.

**Too much product** and we end up with a flakey, non-productive platform that engineers are blamed for, get frustrated with and eventually leave. That creates an even bigger pile of technical debt because you lose all the knowledge when the person walks out the door.

**Too much platform** and we end up with the risk of being overtaken in the market by a competitor.

If customers are complaining about performance and stability, then we have to fix those. It might be that part of a product has hit a brick wall and won’t scale — it might have been rushed initially and corners cut to get it into production.

Please send answers on a postcard as to who is responsible for that when you have split CTO and CPO functions in a business.

To understand whether we have a right product **and** a good platform, we have to be quantitative and return to a set of metrics.

#### How do we measure success?

What metrics can we use to measure the success of a product?

*   **Revenue** — how much revenue is being generated by the product?
*   **Customer Growth** — how many customers we’re acquiring, activating and retaining on the product.

What metrics can we use to measure the success of the platform?

*   **Performance** — do we have acceptable performance and response time for our customers?
*   **Robustness** — do we have reliable uptime figures for the product and related services in the platform?

See also my article on [Non-functional Requirements and OPAQ](https://medium.com/@jonathan.holloway/non-functional-requirements-and-opaq-8b9e895ad37a) for a full list of platform qualities that should be analysed, measured and used.

What about how quickly we can deliver functionality into production?

The problem with this approach is that it’s about **what you deliver** into production. I can certainly deliver a feature faster by skipping testsa nd neglecting robustness and performance issues. Engineering teams struggle with being able to tell you what can be delivered vs when something can be delivered.

We shouldn’t be delivering just features. Otherwise, we become feature factories and are then at the mercy of various issues around system qualities resulting in a platform that requires lots of maintenance and operational effort to maintain.

This balance between product and platform is a tricky thing for a single person to evaluate, judge and ultimately decide on unless they are savvy enough with product and technology. If we have separate roles, then we’re back to negotiation, and usually, somebody needs to arbitrate and decide.

Keeping product and platform metrics aligned under one person is beneficial here because they can then decide on which areas to focus. You can always hire a Head of Engineering and Head of Product under this.

I believe if the company is tech first or the CTO/CPO has the domain experience a combined view is the better way to go.

What’s easier for a person biased towards the CTO or CPO role to learn? The product and market side or the technology side. It can take 20+ years to become a CTO so I’d argue it’s easier for them to pick up the product management side. This is, even more, the case when we’re dealing with deep-tech companies.

### Learning From Each Other

By gaining an appreciation of what product and engineering team members do, we’re in a much better place — compassion, empathy etc.

I’ve seen companies where engineering is perceived as a cost or a service and in some cases perceived as a blocker or just plain lazy in terms of productivity. Conversely, I’ve also seen the elitist engineering teams in deep-tech companies that think product management is a waste of time. If you’re in either of these situations, then that sucks. An appreciation of both product and engineering from both sides is beneficial here.

Product people with a tech background are less common in the UK and Europe than the US. However, there does appear to be a rising trend in having technical Product Managers who understand the engineering side.

For those of you that don’t have this background, it doesn’t stop you from picking up a Udemy/Coursera course and doing a boot camp in Python or Javascript development. Remember that programming is still just part of engineering. You still have to consider infrastructure, mobile, web, front-end, back-end, data, process, tooling, operations. However, this is a massively important skill that will differentiate you from the crowd and allow you to communicate with the team better.

Conversely, what about engineers who don’t have product experience? You may well know the product owner in your team and what they do on a sprint by sprint basis, but what about the bit before that, namely:

*   Talking to customers, understanding different points of view and synthesising that into a set of themes consisting of challenges, opportunities etc.
*   Formulating a set of user journey maps from this synthesis;

Ask if you can sit in on the interviews with customers, the workshops to get an understanding of product discovery. You can also look at how user journies break down into epics and user stories for the development team.

#### Team Consistency

I’m a big fan of multi-disciplinary teams consisting of product owners, engineers, operations etc.. This helps in several ways:

*   You break down the silos with single discipline teams in terms of their views and the political discussions that occur. We’re no longer waiting on a department to do something. I once waited three months for a change to a load balancer to get a feature live and had to drive 600 miles to try and get it to happen!
*   You build trust and relationship amongst the team members providing you can keep the teams stable (you should);
*   You can organise people around a specific goal. That might be shifting a metric in a business (e.g. a conversion metric), it might be improving the reliability of the platform, but it’s not about delivering a feature. Nobody wants a feature factory!

Being outcome-focused rather than technology-focused is the ultimate goal for you as a team. We want to understand:

*   Why we’re building a feature?
*   What problem does it solve for a customer?
*   How it improves the company metrics from a quantitative standpoint?

There’s a helpful article here on being an [outcome-focused](https://medium.com/@max.bennett/great-product-managers-are-outcome-thinkers-66fa5d69cfac) product manager.

### Product and Engineering Healthcheck

Running a health-check for your team is a useful way to understand what you do today, how well you do it, but also what you’re missing and how you can improve as a team. I base the product and engineering health check on the following points:

*   **Product/Platform Roadmap** — do these exist today in the company so that people understand the bigger vision, what they’re working on and where it fits with everything else?
*   **Prioritisation Meeting** — does a prioritisation meeting happen between product and engineering execs today so that we’re building a balanced product for our customers and a great platform?
*   **Embedded Product Owners** — do product members turn up to stand-ups, refinement and planning (or the equivalent) meetings? They need to understand the translation of behaviour into engineering tasks, answer questions and ultimately celebrate success with the team and the wider business.
*   **DEEP Backlogs** — are your [backlogs](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/make-the-product-backlog-deep) detailed to just the right amount (approximately the top 20%)?
*   **Definitions** — does a [definition of ready](https://manifesto.co.uk/the-definition-of-ready/) (DoR) exist so we have all the right things ready for development? Does a [definition of done](https://manifesto.co.uk/definition-done/) (DoD) exist which **defines what good looks like**?
*   **Good User Behaviour Specs** — do you have user behaviour specs that include assumptions, technical considerations and acceptance criteria for sign-off? Do they follow [INVEST](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/)?
*   **Success —** do you hold demos or showcases that feedback to the business on what you’ve achieved in a sprint and quarter?

### Healthcheck Template

See the following document for a template that you can use for a team. I’m open to feedback on how to improve this also!

### In Conclusion

We’ve presented some options for structural design in the organisation for product and engineering, an overview of what the exec-level does and some example metrics by which we can measure progress. Finally, we presented a pure product and engineering health check you can use in your organisation to score yourselves and improve.
