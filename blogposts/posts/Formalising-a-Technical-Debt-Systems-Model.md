Technical Debt is ubiquitous in technology companies and their software. It causes product and engineering team pain, frustration, anger and is often misunderstood. What is it though, where does it come from and why do we care about it? 

Is it just the engineers are moaning again?

Does it mean I have a poor engineering team?

Why can’t we just get things done?

#### **What is technical debt?**

Technical debt is a metaphor that originates from Ward Cunningham. It was coined to be akin to the financial debt that a company comes across. I’m not terribly fond of that comparison. Here’s some others:

Symptoms of technical debt:

*   Lots of support tickets;
*   Developer onboarding taking a long time;
*   Development items (features, improvements) taking a long time;
*   Deadlines are missed (sprints, release dates).

Technical debt works against you, it doesn’t care about productivity, it doesn’t care about value and it doesn’t care about customers.

#### **Where does it come from?**

Technical debt can come from a number of places, let’s look at some examples.

Business Decisions

There are numerous business decisions made that can result in technical debt including:

*   **Shortcuts** — the let’s cut some corners with this solution to meet a deadline. Absolutely a valid thing to do. What is inexcusable is failing to register the shortcut and schedule time to address the item. 
*   **Changing Priorities** —cancelling projects, changing requirements. 
*   People Leaving The Company
*   Poor technical choices/inexperience
*   Product Under/Over-Engineering
*   Incomplete or Missing “Best Practices”
*   Industry Advances/Changes — Flux

**Modelling and Managing Technical Debt**

Ok, it’s very easy to just log a ticket or put something on the backlog, but we can do much much better than that. Also, it’s not that much more effort. Keeping on top of technical debt is key.

Technical debt should be:

*   Categorised
*   Prioritised

And contained in a platform roadmap.

**Conclusion**
