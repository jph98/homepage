OK. There’s one cliched (I see everyone recommend it) book on this list, but the others need some explanation as to why they’re important. What follows is your Christmas reading list if you have some time off. 

### Code Focused Books

#### Clean Code — Uncle Bob Martin

It’s Java and Java gets a lot of hate, but as far as a language goes it has been groundbreaking in the industry from the JVM, providing a proper threading model (ok Javascript, Ruby, Python haters — you don’t have real threads — go fork your process), generics, streams and all the good things.

Clean Code is a great foray into the world of what good code looks like. By good — I mean readable. 

#### Dive Into Python — Mark Pilgrim

Dive Into Python rocks. Python was my second language (in 2006) and I really hit the language hard for scripting, small apps/utilities and API’s (thanks Flask) until I found Ruby.

The best bit of Dive Into Python is that it’s free, online, forever, to whoever, and it’s incredibly well written.

### Branching Outwards Books

As an engineer, you should be practising with coding way more than you read about it. At some point though, you need to branch outwards and develop yourself in other areas.

#### Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer — Sandy Metz

I first saw Sandy talk at Bath Ruby (which is a favourite conference of mine). She’s a great speaker and POODR is a great book on Ruby and Object-Oriented Design.

Of all the languages, my heart lies with Ruby — it’s elegant, beautiful and a joy to write and read (as long as you skip meta-programming). 

#### Pragmatic Thinking and Learning — Andy Hunt

Meta is awesome. I love meta. Who likes meta? — Everyone!

When I came across Pragmatic Thinking and Learning I was excited because I had been looking for a book on **learning to learn** for a long time. It covers a vast array of topics and will act as a multiplier to those of you wanting to learn faster and more effectively. 

#### The Managers Path — Camille Fournier

As an engineer you have to deal with management — there’s no getting away with that.

If you have a flat structure in a company with more than ten people, it’s genuinely going to be a total mess, so you need technical management. What better way to understand your manager and improve your relationship than learning about the art of management.

#### The Practitioner’s Guide To Product Management — Jock Busuttil

Your product manager is your best friend, well sometimes, so getting to know product management is important — from product discovery to product development and everything in-between.

I think engineers should spend some time understand the customer, psychology, interviews, bias, experiments, qualitative vs quantitative. General Assembly’s book is a great introduction to product management.
