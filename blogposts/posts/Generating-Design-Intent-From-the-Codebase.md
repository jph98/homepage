One of things that has always struck me as odd about software development is the sheer number of people who want to start building “straight-away”.

Agile teaches us to build the simplest thing first and this diagram comes to mind. Remember this, build the skateboard, iterate into… yada yada.

Ok, firstly, product-market fit — we need to get there, let’s cut all the corners we reasonably can. There are good ways of doing this and bad ways of doing this. 

Secondly — the route — if we focus on (1) then (2) then (3) etc… in a myopic sort of way then we get there with lots of twists and turns in the process. Considering the routes you could take to get from (1) to (3) are important.

That’s where the thunking part comes in.
