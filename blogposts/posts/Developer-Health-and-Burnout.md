Developer productivity is an often-frowned upon the subject, but there are some genuine factors that affect how productive a developer is. I’m not talking about “how hard people work and how long they work” which is something a lot of investors and VC’s believe is important in a successful startup. The admiration for the Chinese work “ethic” and “culture” which boils down to brutal hours, deteriorating health a.

#### Crunch Time

When I speak to family, relatives and friends about the last 20 years in the tech industry there are an interesting set of focal points. One of the crucial points is how many hours we work and the concept of “crunch time”.

Certain industries are worse than others when it comes to “crunch time” including the games industry where it’s the norm to pull long crunch-time hours to get a game out on time. This is an odd one. Prior to the internet, once your game was recorded to tape (OHAI ZX/C64 friends), disk or cartridge it was pretty much set in stone. However, the always-connected internet generation of games means patches/updates can be shipped over the air. So, in some sense, you can to a degree understand the urgency in the pre-internet generation to get something “perfect” by a given date.

Frontier: Elite 2 on the PC is a good example of a game which is rendered near unplayable by the sheer number of bugs/crashes. These days it’s less important to have something perfect before launch. In the case of Frontier, it really should have been a case of pushing back the release date rather than shipping a buggy product.

#### Crunchtime > Stress, Depression and Anxiety, Burnout

Crunch-time is even more pronounced and prolonged in the startup environment where getting a product to market is critical to the success of the company. You only have so much financial runway here so *building* something quickly is important right?

> Wrong!

Good product management is important. Product discovery is critical here before you jump into building something. That means:

*   Adopting a good framework for personas, user-research and synthesis;
*   Good lo-fi prototypes;
*   Agreement on cutting as many corners as possible when it comes to the product build to reduce the amount of time to market.

Cutting corners at the product level — good, cutting corners at build-time (skipping tests, hacking out solutions — bad).

What are the effects of prolonged crunch-time? Let’s say you’re pushing 50-hour — wait, 60-hour workweeks.

That equates to 12 hours a day, so 9am to 9pm each night. 

Let’s take the commute (assume an hour min for London out of that). That’s 14 hours, so 8am to 10pm each night. 

Let’s take out the wake-up, get dressed, shower (if you’re skipping this I pity your co-workers) and eating breakfast. That’s a minimum of 30 minutes, but really 60 minutes if you’re not rushing. 

We’re down to a 7am to 10pm schedule. 

Let’s take out the dinner, unwinding and relaxing (assuming you haven’t eaten in work). An hour easily, 11pm. 

Hitting the sheets at midnight that means 7 hours effective sleep. 

#### Visible Concerns

*   I’m tired — waking up is super hard
*   I’m forgetful —
*   I’m irritable —
*   Lack of focus

#### Invisible Concerns

*   High blood pressure/cholesterol problems
*   Back and neck issues
*   Relationships — family, friends

#### Your Working Environment

TODO

*   Desk-time — chairs and posture
*   Noise
*   Distractions

#### Technology 

Development Process — TODO: Feedback Time Between Build/Test of Changes.

#### To Cover

*   Release Dates — What drives a release date and what does it, in turn, drive people to do?
*   Outcome vs Output Mindset
