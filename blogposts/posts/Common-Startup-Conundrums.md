Over the last several years I’ve seen lots of startups/scale-ups from pre-seed to seed, series A and beyond. There are lots of pitfalls for companies in these stages of development transitioning to the next stage, it’s a confusing process and incredibly stressful. I cover the following here:

*   Business/Technology Strategy Alignment
*   Lack of Product Management
*   Lack of Technology Leadership

I typically work with companies where technology is an integral part of the business rather than being just a service (tech first not tech-enabled). The consulting work I undertake as an interim/fractional CTO focuses on fixing problems mainly with:

*   Process
*   People
*   Product

A subset of the problems aren't necessarily technical in nature. The people problems in-particular can range from weird to wonderful and everything in-between. I cover a few of these problems here.

#### **Poor Product/Engineering Interface**

The point at which product have to interface with the engineering team is a particular pain-point I come across. I run a general health-check across twelve different areas to work out where the problems are and where to focus. These problems can often affect the following

*   **Project Delivery** — missed deadlines, delivering poor software or delivering the wrong solution;
*   **Adoption of a Product Feature** — ranging from total failure to a need to pivot completely or back-tracking and pulling the product feature altogether;
*   **Unwanted Churn** — product or engineering people leaving the business due to frustration (or with each other
*   **Communication Breakdown** — people not communicating effectively due to inexperience, personality conflicts, blame culture or lack fo psychological safety.

#### **Business/Technology Strategy Alignment**

It’s essential to link strategic objectives up with the perceived outcomes. The OKR (Objectives and Key Results) methodology is often used as a way of establishing this link and use specific metrics to establish how well you’ve met the goal you set out to achieve.

[**OKRs**

#### **Lack of Product Management**

You have your product idea and now you just need someone to build it. Wrong. You need to validate your idea before you build. Why? because it’s expensive to hire engineers and even more expensive to build software — especially the wrong solution. You need to focus on talking to your potential users and understanding their needs, frustrations and challenges. You certainly don’t want them to describe a solution to you! User research and product validation are beyond the scope of this article, but we have lots of articles on the fabulous Mind the Product (MtP) website about user research, synthesis and user journey mapping:

We also teach this during the MtP Essentials Communication and Alignment workshops here:

#### **Lack of Technology Leadership**

Having the right person in the technology leadership role is critical, especially if you are a tech startup rather than a tech-enabled startup. If you want to know the difference check out this Entrepreneur article:

[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/283345](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/283345)

The engineering (and product) team members need a technology leader with:

*   Deep technical experience and experience with product management;
*   Skills to coach them and bring them along in their careers, usually with a career skills matrix or engineering ladder to guide;
*   An understanding of code, infrastructure, design, product and people.

You can’t really get by with a CIO or CPO running engineering. Why?

*   They cannot make tradeoffs between whether to build product features or platform items (including, but not limited to technical debt);
*   They cannot coach engineers in their careers, only in soft skills;
*   They don’t understand how-to guide engineering to build the right solution in terms of quality, cost and time.

You have a few options here also in terms of hiring:

*   Head of engineering
*   VP of engineering
*   Chief Technology Officer

There are several reasons to choose one over the other — around team size, technical competency, stage of the company amongst others.
