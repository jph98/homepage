I’ve been putting writing this off for a long time because it’s a highly contentious subject and one of frustration in the software industry. As software companies and engineering, in general, I think we can agree that:

*   Software often ships late and deadlines are missed;
*   Software is generally intractable;
*   Specification and estimation is non-trivial
*   Crunch-time sucks and has unwanted consequences

There’s lots of research on productivity in the software industry, namely:

There’s also a number of companies that attempt to measure productivity
