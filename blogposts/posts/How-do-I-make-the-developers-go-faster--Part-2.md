In [Part One](https://medium.com/hwintegral-consulting-cto/how-do-i-make-the-developers-go-faster-eb2cf34a1ee2), we talked about many of the problems associated with productivity, focusing on the wrong things and where you can cut corners at the product level. In the final part, I covered the Four Key Metrics from Accelerate:

*   **Lead Time** — the time taken to go from code committed to production;
*   **Deployment Frequency** — how often you deploy;
*   **Failed Deployments** — how many times you rollback a deployment;
*   **Mean Time To Recovery** — if a production incident occurs then how long it takes you to recover.

Since then, I’ve been in the fortunate position of having some key objectives around reporting and measuring various areas of the software development process. 

#### Impact of COVID-19

We have all, unfortunately, also been re(moted) due to COVID-19 which has meant that the process of measurement is even more crucial. It’s not just for optimization, but also prevented unwanted burnout. The common complaints I’ve heard from people include:

*   **Communication challenges** with team members — in particular execs and managers over-communicating with time to do “deep-work” impacted as a result of too many meetings;
*   The challenge with **loneliness**, especially for people who are isolated and on their own;
*   Not being able to **turn off from work** due to blurred boundaries, irregular start/stop times and not enough breaks;
*   Remote meeting [fatigue](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200421-why-zoom-video-chats-are-so-exhausting)!

Github [published an analysis](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-octoverse-spotlight-an-analysis-of-developer-productivity-work-cadence-and-collaboration-in-the-early-days-of-covid-19/#secondtheme) of the statistics around engineering recently during the crisis. It’s a great read and one that highlights the following:
