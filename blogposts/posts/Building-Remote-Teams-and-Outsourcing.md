### Key Rules

My key rules for outsourcing are as follows:

*   Keep the “thinking” in-house – don’t outsource this;
*   Establish your plan for preparing the team Tom onboard;
*   Establish communication protocols with the team – what you communicate over what medium.
*   Establish regular time to visit each other. Ensure you meet the team as soon as possible;
*
