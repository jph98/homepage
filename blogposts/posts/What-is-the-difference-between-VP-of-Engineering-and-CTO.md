It’s a common question and it’s confusing for sure.

I’ve been fortunate to have experience of doing both roles. I definitely have a preference towards CTO rather than VP of engineering personally, but that’s primarily because I spent 8+ years in an engineer and technical architect career path before management roles. I’m deeply technical in short.

The stage of the company is important — early, mid and late stage. For early-stage companies you’ll find yourselves (as I am currently) doing both of these — managing the team and the technical strategy and partnerships.

The role changes as the team and company grows and matures and at some point you’ll come to an impasse where you have to decide:

*   Which role you want to do?
*   Which role you go out and hire for?

Preference is part of this, suitability and skill of doing the role is the other, so choose wisely : )

### The VP of Engineering Part

### The CTO Part

*   Technology partnerships focus

### Working Together

If we consider the intersection between the two roles this is what you’ll end up working on with your newly found partner in crime:

*   Strategy to Operational Delivery
*   Technology, People and Skills
*   Problem Solving, Blocker Removal and People Problems
