Contentious as it may be, I’ve seen both technology and product work across many businesses and I’ve come to the conclusion that “product managers” leading “engineers” simply do not work.

Let’s clarify what I mean by that:

Product Managers have to be technical. They should have a technical background having spent time as an engineer, because they need to understand what they are building and also what quantity of product and platform to focus on. 

I want to be able to ask a product manager:

*   What should we focus on for Q4 in terms of capability — should we utilize a business process engine to reduce development cost/effort or should we have the engineers code a process engine for scalability reasons?
*   How do we innovate based on the data we have using predictive analytics to convert users and cross-sell products?

I’ve heard the “I don’t care about the internals of the black box — leave it to the team” and frankly that just doesn’t work when you have multiple teams with multiple viewpoints or a junior engineering team that lacks the experience or skills. 

Who spots the gaps here and proposes that “we should hire a senior backend engineer” or “we need better DevOps capability”?

Engineers aren’t blameless either, they
