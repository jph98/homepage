As an engineer, within the place of work, there are opportunities to grow and upskill as part of your day to day work in product development. Work could involve maintenance (bug fixing, modifications) or feature development for new products. You might specialise more in backend building services that manipulate/store data. You might specialise in front-end user interface components, communicating with API’s etc…

There are a number of skills you have to develop here, namely:

*   **Technical expertise** in your language and area of speciality (front-end, back-end development, data science/engineering);
*   **Collaborating** and working with others in a team, dealing with conflict, problem-solving and working with success and failure;
*   The **interviewing, coaching and onboarding** of new members of the team and developing them into becoming seniors;
*   Handling **larger and more ambiguous problems** – breaking them down into solutions and engineering tasks to produce design and estimates for the business.

#### Improving Skills Outside of Work

Outside of the workplace, there are also ways to develop these skills, or gain additional skills and accelerate your growth as an engineer. Becoming a Senior Engineer might take between 5 and 8 years of effort. However, being a Senior Engineer in one company is not the same as another company. There’s a different baseline based on the competency of the team and those around you and there’s no truly accepted growth framework for engineering.

The time you have outside work needs to be used effectively, especially since you’re giving up that time when you could be relaxing.

The article that follows talks about NPH and spending time watching masterful actors on Broadway studying their craft. That meant watching up to ten or so Broadway shows to develop his craft, and yes Harold and Kumar Go To Whitecastle counts : )

The **observation** of someone performing out their art rather than just talking about it is can be more effective for some people. In the tech industry, there are a number of ways we can use our time effectively to improve our skills. Let’s look at a few and the time required, the effectiveness (from low to high) and the barrier to entry.

#### Participating in Meetups

One way to learn about technology is by attending a meetup on a specific subject, that might be a language meetup (e.g. Javascript) or a meetup around a specific piece of tech (e.g. React Native).

By watching someone present on a topic in this context you can learn the way they’ve built something. That includes the challenges, pitfalls and methods they employed along the way. The quality of talks and speakers varies of course and you might find that the talk you thought you were getting isn’t quite the same talk. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with leaving the meetup, by the way, to focus on something else. They’ll understand.

The real value of the meetup for me is in taking part in the discussion afterwards. That means approaching other people (possibly the speaker) and asking questions about their talk, or best-practices or asking for advice on a problem you might have in a project. If you’re in a group make sure you try to follow the Pacman rule to aid inclusivity of others into the conversation. If someone new comes along, introduce yourself.

Conferences allow people to…*www.ericholscher.com](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/ "https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/")[](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/)

*   **Time Required**: Medium (2 hours to attend)
*   **Effectiveness**: Low/Mid (dependent on speaker and content quality)
*   **Barrier to Entry**: Low (signup on Meetup.com and go along)

The other side of meetups is developing a talk yourself and approaching the organisers (on meetup.com or other) with the idea to give the talk. We’re always short of speakers for meetups so it’s always refreshing to have someone new ask whether they could do a talk. Doing a talk yourself develops confidence, presentation skills and conveying complex ideas to a wide range of people. That’s incredibly helpful when it comes to interviews and evangelising your company. It also helps with recruitment!

*   **Time Required**: Medium/High (10 hours per 1 hour speaking)
*   **Effectiveness**: Mid/High
*   **Barrier to Entry**: Low

#### Joining an Open-Source Project

One way to learn is by doing more software development — using a project that already exists. Joining an open-source project – starting by contributing bug fixes and improvements is a way to do this. Working up to [Committer Status](https://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html) can be incredibly rewarding and it’s a great thing to put on your CV/resume.

The barrier to entry here, however, can be quite tough. People on the projects have given up their free time (and sometimes it’s their day job also). Getting support might not be that easy.

If you want to get involved in an open-source project look at the Apache Foundation for an example of the types of projects you could get involved with and how to go about this.

[**Get Involved**

*   **Time Required**: High (several evenings a week or weekends)
*   **Effectiveness**: High (you’re likely to be working with great engineers)
*   **Barrier to Entry**: High (requires lots of patience and codebase reading)

#### Taking Online Courses

Prior to 2010, good online video-based courses were scarce. We had digital books and things like Oreilly’s great Safari offering. Since then, we’ve seen professional online video-based course tools appear including:

*   Udemy — [https://www.udemy.com/](https://www.udemy.com/)
*   Coursera — [https://www.coursera.org/](https://www.coursera.org/)
*   Khan Academy — [https://www.khanacademy.org/](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

I love Khan Academy, it helped me fill in the gaps for the math required for game development (trigonometry) and also for machine learning and data science (linear algebra). Coursera and Udemy have helped with developing React Native mobile apps, improving my mad guitar shredding skills (they’re not that mad honest), cooking and cosmetic science (really).

Both of these are cost-effective (< £10 in most cases) to upskill on a specific piece of technology or technique. I’d like to give a shout-out to [MasterClass](https://www.masterclass.com/) as well who provide a “Learn From the Best” approach with the likes of Gordon Ramsey for cooking, deadmau5 (electronic music production) and Margaret Atwood (creative writing).

Following the courses and building an app and idea that’s been built by someone else if great and all. However, it can be hard to find passion within that given process. I often find myself coming to the end of the process and feeling a little hollow. The real value for me is in the notes I take during the process (which I make and publish on Github for future reference). That way when I come back to it, I have some context (take my 3 months of Wordpress shittery for-example fixing core issues in bizarre online learning plugins).

*   **Time Required**: Low/Medium (one or two modules an evening)
*   **Effectiveness**: Medium/High (depends on the course and tutor)
*   **Barrier to Entry**: Low (there are loads of options out there)

### Side Projects

OK, so my favourite option for upskilling outside work is a combination of the above. I use meetups and conferences (we didn’t talk about those) for ideation, courses to learn new tech, but I absolutely then have to apply that in some way.

> Meetups + Online Course + Side Projects = Winning

I find a number of things beneficial about this approach:

*   You’re able to start the project from the **very beginning**. That means you can select the language, frameworks, libraries, build tools, repository, CI/CD etc… which gives you the experience of understanding the setup process. Don’t add too many new things otherwise the learning curve might be too steep. This is definitely beneficial over the open-source project in terms of barrier to entry;
*   You get to potentially build a **totally different type** of application to your day job (mobile vs web vs backend API vs data project). You can broaden your skills towards another area. It also looks great on a CV/resume.
*   You can explore a new domain or area. For example, I was always interested in simulations after playing Chris Sawyer’s Transport Tycoon. I was also interested in [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) and Cellular Automata, so decided to build Conway's Game of Life for myself. It was fairly trivial to build a Linux console-based Ruby version of it. However, it then led me to learn about [Curses in Linux](https://github.com/ruby/curses), which then led to [Pixi.js](https://www.pixijs.com/) and 2D WebGL rendering on HTML Canvas. That then led to learning and building on [Unity](https://unity.com/) as a 2D game engine, of which I’m still a noob, but hey.

[**It From Bit: Is The Universe A Cellular Automaton?**  
*From a few simple rules to complex existence, could it be that the Universe isn’t ruled by physics, but by binary?*medium.com](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/it-from-bit-is-the-universe-a-cellular-automaton-4a5b1426ba6d "https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/it-from-bit-is-the-universe-a-cellular-automaton-4a5b1426ba6d")[](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/it-from-bit-is-the-universe-a-cellular-automaton-4a5b1426ba6d)

The great thing about a side-project is that when it’s at a certain point you can then start to apply some non-technical skills to it. Firstly, you start to think about the features you can add. Stick those in the README.md for now — just brief one-liners. That is your future roadmap for the project. Secondly, you can involve other people in the project and collaborate with them on some of the tasks you have. Thirdly, you can talk about your project at a conference/meetup and get ideas from other people or find out about other related projects. It’s a great context for learning and development — I’m currently headlong into GCP functions, firestore to support a React Native app for curated content and learning.

*   **Time Required**: Medium (depends on the task you pick up in the time)
*   **Effectiveness**: High
*   **Barrier to Entry**: Low (coming up with an idea is the hardest part)

#### Choose your task to focus on wisely

One of the biggest challenges with your side-project is being realistic about the time you have available — whether than be an hour, an evening, a day or a weekend. I once used a holiday to build out a game of Battleships in Pixi.js (don’t do that). Choose a task that fits the time you have available — if I’m on a train for example then I know what I can achieve in an hour so I chose my task accordingly — implementing a small feature, fixing a bug, doing some refactoring of the code, writing some documentation.

Always leave something you can’t complete in the time available in a good place with a TODO or a FIXME. Don’t leave things on a problem which then means that the entry-point back into your side-project becomes harder! That might kill your project altogether for a week or so. If that happens then try to rewind the project a bit and focus on an easy task you can complete first. That often means I have the enthusiasm to pickup a more difficult task.

#### Optimising Your Time for Side Projects

Optimising your overall week and days for side-projects can be tough – but don’t give up – there are definitely ways to achieve this:

*   Keep your side project work-related and invest your 20% time in it with the support of your employer;
*   Work for a larger company and avoid the “startup” culture which means longer hours and pressure to work overtime. This means you still have some energy left over to put into something else;
*   Look at part-time or contract-based work which can fund your time off to focus on your side-project. That gives you the benefit of buying time! If you are going down the contract route — remember — it should be a short term process with specific exit criteria.
*   Target your time towards a skill which doesn’t zap your energy to code. I find that if I’m coding/pairing for a full day (approx 5 productive hours) then it diminishes my enthusisasm and energy to pickup the keyboard when I get home.

#### Problem #1 Side Project Ideation

Ideation is one of the core problems faced when trying to come up with a project to work on. How do we find a suitable problem to work on as a project? This is tough to start, but becomes easier.

When you have an idea, write it down. Where? Use Notes on OSX, or use Evernote. Carry a notebook with you and jot the idea down there. Forget about it for now. It doesn’t matter how stupid it is, it doesn’t matter if it’s been done before.

We’ve mentioned conferences/meetups to discover ideas to work on, but there’s a few other sources as well:

*   Pick a **new domain** and explore it, e.g. biosciences, climate change etc… Read Hacker News, TechCrunch, National Geographic, the tech section in the Sunday newspaper. There’s tons of great material out there.
*   Look at **datasets in** [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). That will provide you with the raw data, but also some context around the dataset. As of today, there’s projects you could look at involving Forest Fires in Brazil, data on Mobile Strategy Games and Amazon Cell Phone Reviews. Explore the dataset and try and find some insight and a potential project.
*   Look at **books that explore concepts** or projects. [**Practical Ruby Projects**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Ruby-Projects-Programmer-Professionals/dp/159059911X) is a great example and it’s £2.17 used on Amazon. You don’t have to use Ruby for the projects at all — it covers Making Music, Turn Based Strategy and Genetic Algorithms. Hurrah.
*   Take one of your other **hobbies** and explore that. My big focus has been on music — guitar-based and electronic-based music. I’ve used that to build a second-hand instrument marketplace, a desktop sequencer and more recently a guitar tab sync/browser for Spotify.

#### Conclusion

Being an engineer with a side-project puts you in a powerful place. Not just because of the technical, project and people skills you’ve acquired. It’s fundamentally an idea for a startup

> It doesn’t matter whether it’s been done before.

An idea can always be done better, it can always offer a compelling and innovative approach to solving the same problem more efficiently or with a twist. Take Spotify or Slack for example — there were plenty of solutions that preceded those that were utter failures. I wonder how many people thought Slack was a stupid idea when Stewart Butterfield proposed it. “Why? What’s the point?“ they will have cried. Remember.

> Your personal project may be your next startup!

As a final point, please please please remember downtime, getting out and reducing your screen-time is important in terms of mental health. You need a break from work and knowing when you’ve hit a wall is an important to understand. The article above talks about the importance of relationships, the outdoors and seeking inspiration elsewhere. Burnout sucks – don’t go there!
