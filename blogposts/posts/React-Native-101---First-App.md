React Native provides an easy entry point into mobile application development. I’ve used it to build several apps over the last year. I’ve been down the Android route with Kotlin and the iOS route with Swift as well (I def. rate it as a way to build apps), but React Native is a bit easier for newcomers and you can really build things out very quickly. 

  

#### React Native Component Lifecycle

I think with every framework or library it’s essential to understand the basics to appreciate what’s going on when building something.

#### Introducing Expo

Expo provides a basis for your React Native app in terms of building blocks. I’ve mainly used it because:

*   It provides nice **native wrappers** for iOS and Android functionality;
*   You can easily **build and publish** APK’s for Android or IPA’s for Apple;
*   You can build and test locally (using the simulator) and **test on a device** using the Expo app which can be installed on your mobile devices;
*   You can issue **over the air** (OTA) updates without republishing your app.

BTW: You could just go Milli Vanilli and use plain old React Native. I won’t go into the pros and cons of this or the native vs React Native approach, but Expo works just fine and you can use it in production, no problem.

#### Building Your First App — Project Setup

I suggest using the scaffolding project I provide for React Native when you’re following this. We’re going to build a simple application that demonstrates the basic features of React Native.

#### Adding Your First Screen

*   Layout
*   Components
*   Handlers

#### Conclusion

React Native is great for getting up to speed quickly with mobile application development. Hopefully, you have something up and running at the end of this exercise which you can now extend to your requirements. Good luck.
