Micro-services are trendy for sure, but the concepts here aren’t new.

**Domain Driven Design** appeared in 2003 to describe a language given by domain experts for describing system requirements. The domain element is the important part here.

**Service-Oriented Architecture** appeared even earlier than this in 1998 and described a style of architecture that models business activities as a set of services.

But we can go back further than that even. **CORBA** appeared in 1992 and was described as a way of enabling communication between software written in different languages and running on different computers.

The term **micro web services** were first used in 2005 by Peter Rogers at a cloud computing event. Netflix and Amazon were amongst the first to do this.

I don’t want to go into the “should I” or “shouldn’t I” argument, but if you’re pre-revenue and startup then be wary when somebody proposes this and understand the work and business implications.
