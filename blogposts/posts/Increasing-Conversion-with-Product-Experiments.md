We all want our online businesses to grow. That means more orders or subscriptions and more revenue to reinvest. There are several ways to increase conversion by running experiments. That means running tests with changes to one or more aspects of our sales funnel to understand if they are making sales better or worse.

#### The Hypothesis

Every great experiment starts with a hypothesis we were taught in secondary/high school. Why is your conversion problem any different? It’s not. 

Choosing your hypothesis (grading/ranking).

*   Testing colour
*   Different images
*   Different landing pages
*   Keep forms short
*   Discount percentage

#### Types of Experiments

There’s various forms of experiments you can run to try and increase conversion:

*   Split (A/B) test
*   Multivariate test
*   Multi-armed bandit test

#### Split Tests

Most split tests will only bring about a 5% gain approx.

Failed experiments are good.

Control and Treatment

Statistical Significance

#### Tools

*   Google Optimize

Split tests are an effective way to increase conversion with your product. This is the first in a three-part series on testing, data analysis and visualisation for product managers wanting to learn more about data and analytics.
