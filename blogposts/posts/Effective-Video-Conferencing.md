Effective video conferencing is important, especially given our current situation. Not everyone is experienced with video conferencing or fulltime remote working. Neither has everyone got the technical competence to improve their computer setup or WIFI connectivity.

Here are my personal thoughts and suggestions on how to better connect via video calls. I’m a big Zoom user so this is somewhat biased towards this solution. *P.S.

#### Audio Tips

Improve your audio solution. This doesn’t just apply to video calls, but phone calls as well. My Apple Earbuds are pretty effective at drowning out background noise. If I couple this with effective muting techniques on my phone then it’s passable if I’m in the train station or out and about in London. *It doesn’t work on GWR from the West Country to London, but that’s a different story : )* Those aside, make sure you have a decent mic and that you’re close to that mic. **Don’t shout.** I read an article recently that said you should speak 10% louder. If somebody can show me what 10% is that’d be great. Just speak a little bit louder and ask at the start of the call if you’re too loud or quiet if you’re worried.

#### Hardware Tips

If your laptop is docked and you use an external monitor, you will need to find an alternative solution, otherwise, you’ll need to un-dock to be able to use your built-in camera. In my case I use a sidecar, which is an Apple iPad Pro and a Lamicall Gooseneck arm:

You don’t need to spend hundreds of pounds on a solution here. You could just buy an integrated audio/video camera with a good mic:

#### Connectivity Tips

If you’re having connectivity issues I suggest the following:

*   Turn off your video to reduce bandwidth, so that you can keep going with the call and diagnose later on;
*   Use the dial-in option instead to connect to the call.

On the subject of bandwidth, make sure you have a good connection. To be on the safe side, you need at least 3.0 MBps down for a good experience. If you’re not sure exactly what your connection is capable of then use Google Speed Test.

If you have massive problems then consider using a wired, rather than a wireless connection. If you’re on Virgin btw and have the awful SuperHub they provide as a modem/router then you’ll struggle when you have several devices connected to it. I solved this by putting it in modem mode and then purchasing a decent Asus RT-AC66U\_B1 WIFI router. Guess what — no more wifi issues.

If you’re on Mac and you hold down the Alt key and click the wifi symbol (screenshot below) you can also get wireless diagnostics. Make sure you enable WIFI logging to diagnose issues as well.

Have you tried turning it on and off again? The router that is. That can help and it was previously our standard solution when having connectivity issues with our old Virgin router. Try reducing the number of connected devices also!

#### Work/Family Tips

Don’t try and hide or cover up the issues at home. I have two dogs that tend to bark when someone comes to the door (hey, it’s a good thing as well as a bad thing), but I will apologise, put myself on mute and wait for them to stop. Likewise, if one wanders into the room or jumps up on the sofa when I’m doing a video call from there instead. If you have kids then there’s a great article from Buffer here with 21 tips for working from home:

#### Conversation Tips

Conversation wise, you need to be self-aware of how you’re communicating with others.

Be **conversational tight (concise)** within the meeting. If you’re talking for more than 15–20 seconds, then try and adjust accordingly. Slow your speech down as well — you should be able to make your point in a few sentences. Sometimes, it helps to think about the point you’re making ahead of time — jot down the points you need to make ahead of time then that can help you to be concise on the call and get the points across that are important to the meeting subject.

If you’re talking and **somebody tries to talk over you** then continue and finish your point. The other person will usually stop what they’re trying to say and allow you to finish. If they don’t, then you have a problem that needs to be addressed with them after the meeting OR you have to call them out on it there and then. I don’t like doing the latter, because it adds tension to the meeting, but if the same person is consistently shutting you down then you need to address that.

Provide **meeting context** via documents for pre-reading to help explain the meeting beforehand. If you need to illustrate a complex idea/concept then there are a few ways to do this — first you can share your screen and demonstrate. Alternatively, you can use the chat window to copy a link to a diagram that people can then to refer to. This is great, but it isn’t very interactive — sharing the diagram on your screen helps here.

People **talking over you** and people **monopolising the conversation** are two common problems in video calls, as well as in in-person meetings. The person who arranged the meeting is the facilitator — it’s their responsibility to “keep court” and ensure that people get heard and that people who tend to monopolise are kept in order. Appoint a facilitator if you have to.

If you only have **specific time allocated** to present something then set a silent timer on your phone or on your desktop. You can also google “timer 10 minutes” and it will start a timer. It does end with audible annoying “dinner is ready” audio so make sure you mute that!

#### Retrospective: Review your Video Calls

Remember the [six different types of meetings](http://meetingsift.com/the-six-types-of-meetings/). Think about all the video calls you had last week and group them:

*   **Status Updates** — One to Ones — was it a sprawling mess of nice chats with no structure and unclear outcomes?
*   **Information Sharing** — e.g. the tech/engineering team meeting;
*   **Planning/Decision Making** — working out what you’re going to work on in the next few weeks.
*   **Problem Solving —** how can we solve problem x that we’re facing, this might be a production issue or a given design/development problems;
*   **Innovation —** how can we improve x, e.g. observability of our platform?
*   **Team Building —** retrospectives themselves to understand continuous improvements;

Now, arrange retrospectives to review with the various team members how you can improve on these types of meetings.

*   What worked well?
*   What didn’t work well?
*   What should you continue to do and improve upon?

It’s more important than ever to ensure you are efficient and effective in terms of your meetings. Are there more of them than normal since remote working started? There sure are with me.
