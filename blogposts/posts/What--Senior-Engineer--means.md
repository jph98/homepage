Moving from a mid-level engineer into a senior engineer role is confusing. There are many opinions on what “senior” means.

Past Senior Engineer there’s typically two paths you can chose, but it’s not the end path at all.

*   Technical Leadership
*   Engineering Management

How do the two differ in

the Lead Engineer and/or the Principal Engineer role. I split these into two paths:

*   Engineering Management – leading a team, people management and guiding a project in terms of design, best-practices and 
*   Lead Engineer – commercial awareness, product minded, 

#### Where should time be spent?

Where should time be spent as a Senior Engineer? I’d split it into the following four activities:

*   Engineering (core) – 60% of your time
*   Coaching (act as a multiplier) – 20% of your time
*   Hiring (Always be hiring) – 10%
*   Analysis and Design (Clearing the decks) – 10%

The percentage of time you spend on each of these may change based on:

*   Size of the team (no more than 5 in my rule)
*   Presence of an Engineering Manager who leads on people hiring, processes etc…

  

#### Coaching – Act as a multiplier, not just as an individual contributor

#### Hiring – Always be hiring
