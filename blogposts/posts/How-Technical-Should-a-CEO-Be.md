How technical should a CEO of technology startup be? Tech-first and tech-enabled startups differ enormously here. 

Why is it important?

It’s important for a number of reasons:

**Reason One.** You’re able to call bullshit on something when dealing with a given situation:

*   An agency trying to overcharge you for something;

**Reason Two.** The mental health of your CTO, Engineering Director and the engineering team.

### What You Should Know Conceptually

Let’s outline a set of areas where you should understand the basics — conceptually. This might vary based on relevance to your startup area, but 

*   How to interface with your technology lead
*   Choosing Technology — build/buy/integrate
*   Cloud Technology — AWS/GCP, compute, storage
*   Data — storage/retrieval
*   What engineers care about
*   Engineering Management Terminology — agile/technical debt/sprints/productivity

#### How to interface with your technology lead

If you have a CTO, VP of engineering, head of engineering then there’s a certain way in which you should approach situations to get the best out of the relationship.

It doesn’t always work like this, and if you need help then contact me and I can advise. 

#### Build/Buy/Integrate

This is an important one, and it’s contextual and multi-faceted as well. Generally, when building a solution you have a few options:

*   **Build** — from scratch, which provides you with ultimate flexibility, but takes and costs longer;
*   **Buy** — purchase a product which can do x. This provides you with flexibility (but not as a much as a custom build) and is quite often cheaper than the Build solution.
*   **Integrate —** take something open-source and integrate into your 

### How To Acquire This Knowledge

I mean, you could treat this like the MBA — do it on the job rather than investing hundreds of thousands of pounds in it, right? Alternatively, you could just invest a few evenings effort and learn it online through some courses.

The trick here is in finding an explanation that’s in plain English. Technology folks have a habit of a few things:

1.  Over-complicating things and not explaining them in plain English — it might be information overload, or it might be presented at totally the wrong level. 
2.  Explaining why something is awesome (the benefits), but not explaining the drawbacks, including the costs of doing something.
