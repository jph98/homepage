This is not a technical post, this is about “code” — yes, but the key message here is how that code affects your ability to operate as a tech-first or tech-enabled business.

If you don’t care about product/engineering, the geeks sat in the corner or what the teams are telling you then you’re in for a bit of a shock. That might not be a few weeks, months away, but at some point, it’s going to crush you and your business like that massive stone in Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Youtube clip for those who haven’t seen it:

The structure of your companies code can have an impact on many things in your organisation including, but not limited to:

*   **Productivity** — how efficiently users can add new features or adapt the system to the changing business;
*   **Engineer Retention** — how long you’re able to keep engineers on average based on the impact that working in the codebase has on them;
*   **Internal Quality** — how easy the code is to test internally so that you don’t piss your customers off with poor solutions that affect their ability to do their jobs;

Why? How can something so small have such a great effect?

Surely, it’s a vanity exercise — nice code, happy developers. Like toys and children? 

Is it fuck.
