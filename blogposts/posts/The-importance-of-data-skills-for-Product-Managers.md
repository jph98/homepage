The vernacular required to have conversations with data teams

Data Lake Technology and Big Data

*   Vernacular of data to have conversations with your data teams

Product Managers and Product Management is **perceived** as a relatively new concept. The concepts go back to the 1930s at Proctor and Gamble as a discipline. There’s a great article here on the history and evolution of the product manager.

*Both new and experienced product managers often ask where this role came from and why it seems to have so much…*www.mindtheproduct.com](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/history-evolution-product-management/ "https://www.mindtheproduct.com/history-evolution-product-management/")[](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/history-evolution-product-management/)

Skills wise — there’s a great deal of crossover with other disciplines that make up the product manager role, including:

*   Marketing;
*   User Experience;
*   Technology.

The technology part here is interesting and begs the question. 

> How technical do I need to be as a product manager? 

The technology landscape is vast, but one area which is important to understand is data. It binds together users and what they do with our products. It is important because it allows us to tell stories, backup opinions and influence stakeholders regarding changes to products.

Gaining the skills to analyse, manipulate and visualise data in different ways can help you gain a competitive advantage over other product people in the industry. Let’s look at some common tools and techniques that can help you do that.

Qualitative and quantitative data.

Types of metrics — vanity etc… KPI trees

Don’t have the data?

*   Basics — hypothesis, experiment, data (quantitative)
*   Types of tests — A/B tests, multivariate tests

Teams organised around metrics, working towards metrics with projects.

Survey around the usage of the product (in 2016!!!):

*   New UI + Desktop Sync App
*   2016 data

Eating your own dog food! 

*   List of features in product (did they use it) — boolean
*   How important it was to their day job (1–5)

Generate some graphs from this!

Lily — spreadsheet — view data and calculates — show people the sheet.

  

### Interpreting Data and Data Analysis

*   Bias
*   Statistical Significance

### Where Data Comes From

Where data comes from?

*   Product Google Analytics/Google Optimise
*   Surveys and response data (qualitative data)
*   NPS Survey

What do we do with this data?

*   Interpretation of data

### Spreadsheets 101

Most people understand spreadsheets. They’re a powerful concept, derived from book-keeping ledgers that originated in the 1960s. 

Most know how to view a spreadsheet, enter/modify data and do some basic data analysis, but going beyond this there are a number of more advanced features that can help us, namely:

*   Functions
*   Pivot Tables
*   Charts

Let’s look at using Google Sheets for demonstrating these features.

#### Functions

Functions are a fundamental building block in mathematics and computer science. 

#### Pivot Tables

Pivot Tables allow us to… 

#### Summary Statistics

Looking at data and understanding the basic shape of it is useful. There are some ways to get an overview of statistics for each column in the spreadsheet so you can understand whether:

*   Values are missing and require attention;
*   Average, median and percentiles for numeric values;

Google Sheets isn’t fantastic at doing this and you need to do a fair bit of manual work with functions to generate this.

### Databases 101

Databases aren’t that different to spreadsheets in structure in the basic sense. However, they do offer a lot of advantages over spreadsheets which is why they are the defacto standard data storage and retrieval tool used in tech.

#### Querying data (basic)

TODO

### Visualisation and Dashboards

A great starting point for dashboards, particularly in startups is Google Sheets.

###   

In Conclusion

Learning the basics of spreadsheets, databases and a basic dashboard tool put you in a powerful position.
