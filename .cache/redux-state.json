I've  spent 17+ years covering a wide number of roles in the product/tech industry building companies, teams and software/hardware solutions.  I invest in pet-tech, ed-tech and F&B companies.  The majority of my work these days is in London, where I live although I've also worked in Germany (Berlin, Hamburg, Dusseldorf), Holland (Amsterdam) and North America (New York, Boston, San Francisco and Vancouver).\n\n#### Research\n\nI studied software engineering from Aberystwyth University, receiving an MEng in 2003.  My final year project was spun out as a set of research papers and a startup that was funded to build learning platforms in higher education. I then studied and attained an MPhil over the next few years working on software design between academia and industry.  I completed my Viva in 2008.  \n\nI was a frequent participant in Stackoverflow (47k, top 0.5%), mostly in the Java, Python and Javascript spaces.\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/users/82865/jon\n\nI'm an active coder got Github with a few hundred repositories, some personal projects, some scaffolding starter projects for frameworks such as Flask, React Native mobile applications for B2C ventures, devops tooling (log file viewer/seacher) and tooling for architecture/design - service canvas design and implicit rules.\n\nhttps://github.com/jph98\n\nI've also run meetups in the past, I founded the South West JVM meetup which still runs out of Bristol:\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/South-West-Java/\n\n#### What?\n\nI've worked in the following roles:\n\n* **CTO** - building products and teams as the first employee, growing teams to around 100 in size.  Architecting and coding v1 of the product and beyond in-house and with agencies.\n\n* **VP of Eng/Engineering Manager** - building and growing teams, understanding teams and people and what makes them successful.  I did research in the academic world on what engineers need going into industry and work on various talks, papers and do research in this area.\n\n* **Engineer** - working with deep-tech companies for many years building complex products/SaaS platforms using Java/Python/Javascript/Ruby technology, often utilising predictive analytics.  Mixture of web and mobile.\n\n* **Product Manager** - working on the product/engineering interface, user interviews, synthesis and product validation.  \n\n* **Founder/Co-founder** - I've founded/co-founded several startups in the e-commerce, ed-tech, health-tech and pet-tech world.  \n\n---\n\n#### Where?\n\n**Location Wise** - I've worked at/consulted at/founded tech companies in Bristol, London, Berlin and Vancouver, understanding the tech ecosystems, startup scene and the unique challenges of each country and city.\n\nI've worked with many companies in:\n\n* **eCommerce** - both B2C and B2B SaaS platforms, complex integrations, point of sale and storefront work\n* **Archiving/compliance** - mainly in the financial sector for multi petabyte problems with messaging\n* **Pharma/health-tech** - on drug modelling, mental health applications and general health applications\n* **Adtech** - on behavioural analytics and large scale data problems\n* **Prop-tech** - on real-estate pricing, comparison as well as co-living\n* **Insurance** - on analytical model development and data engineering for calculating premiums and risk\n* **Ed-tech** - building and selling educational and assessment tools for higher education\n\n\n---\n\n#### Who?\n\n**Early Stage Startups/Scaleups** - On the startup side I was fortunate to get involved in an early stage (pre 2000's) eCommerce auction startup, spin my final year university project out as a startup company that grew to nearly 20 people in size, co-found health-tech, pet-tech and prop tech-startups.\n\n**Mid/Late Stage Companies** - On the mid and late stage company side I've been involved in leading of multi-million pound projects for companies such as Flybe, Kingfisher and Brightpearl as well as several FTSE 100 companies, .gov related companiess in various consulting roles.  \n\n\n#### Building...\n\n* Enterprise solutions for companies, such as **Flybe** (online checkin, seat assignment, customer accounts) and **Kingfisher** (machine learning search engine replacement)\n* Several **eCommerce platforms** with complex integrations from storefronts with **ATG, Shopify** to payment providers such as **Datacash** to B2B integrations with **eBay, Amazon, Alibaba and Shopify**\n* SaaS platforms supporting hundreds of thousands of users (Global Relay, Brightpearl)\n* Worked with **big data, distributed grids** and analytic problems for **clothes fitting, drug modelling, search engines, GIS mapping**\n* Worked with **ad-tech platforms** of various scale and complexity\n* Worked in **Java, Javascript, Python, Ruby** ecosystems using a variety of frameworks, libraries and tools\n* **Web** applications with so many frameworks I can't possibly list them\n* **Mobile** applications for **point of sale** and **pet-technology** with native and React Native tech\n\n---",

        "content": "\n![](../cto.png)\n\n\n#### CTO Services\n\n###### What do you do?\n\nIt depends on the company and problems, but in summary:\n\n* Grow startups from seed to series A, B and beyond\n* Stabilise teams and businesses when communication has broken down or key people have left\n* Product discovery, development and helping companies with product & technology roadmaps and execution\n* Architect, design and develop applications with the teams\n\n###### How do you start with a company?\n\nI normally carry out discovery over three to five days and write a report on product, process and people with an aim to transform the business depending on the problems.  I'll work closely with teams and work hands-on with engineers, devops, product, QA and the wider business.\n\n###### How do you work in an interim capacity?\n\nI typically work in one interim role at a time.  That involves three to four days working with companies and their product/engineering teams on-site predominantly.  I use my other day for fractional work and startup advisory.\n\n--- \n\n###### How do you work in a fractional capacity?\n\nThis might involve one day a week or a few days a month depending on the problems the company is trying to solve.  I usually work with existing teams, analyse specific problems, set goals and coach teams towards those.  This is on-site.\n\n--- \n\n###### Why do I need a CTO?\n\nThe role of the CTO is often confusing and very different depending on the stage of company. There's a good article by McKinsey consulting on the subject - [Why you need a CTO](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/why-you-need-a-cto-and-how-to-make-her-successful)\n\n---\n\n###### How is it different to a head of/VP of engineering?\n\nI believe that CTO's at a point in their career in a company make a choice - either to remain hands on/technical or to move more into a people management/product strategy role - [Defining Roles - CTO and/or VP of Engineering](https://medium.com/engineering-leadership/defining-roles-cto-and-or-vp-engineering-f1c7563643a3)\n\n--- \n\n###### What problems do you work on?\n\nI've worked with the following problem areas, but please get in contact if you have something other than this.\n\n---\n**My CTO/lead engineer is leaving**\n\nIn the unfortunate situation whereby your most senior product/tech is leaving I can help with bridging the gap until you find the next person.  In some situations it's necessary to understand why they have left and solve the root cause or set of problems that led to the situation.  \n\n--- \n\n**\"I need to build a team in-house to build out the product\"**\n\nI can help with building a product and engineering team from the very beginning of the company journey.  I help founders find the right product/tech people and also advise on when the right time is to bring in specific roles to the business, including a CTO, VP/head of engineering, devops engineers etc..\n\n--- \n\n**I need to bring a product in-house from an agency**\n\nIt's great having an agency build out a product for you, but there are lots of questions that should be asked prior to the build of a product.  There are also key checkpoints and ways to ensure you build a scalable product or platform from the beginning, rather than it being an after-thought.

I help with transformation of people, process and product to solve issues that people might be having.\n\n--- \n\n**We're having issues with delivery**\n\nThere's a common problem with project delivery in the software industry.  This is a non-trivial area in-which I can help a business identify what they're delivering, and the issues with measurement around delivery.

The individual contributor vs manager split is often mis-understood here.\n\n**We'd like to outsource functions or parts of the software**\n\nOutsourcing isn't quite as straightforward as it sounds.  There are many challenges/hurdles to overcome, especially if the team haven't done this before.  Should you outsource parts of the product or specific roles (e.g. testing)?  I can help with the outsourcing problem, preparing the product/engineering function for outsourced projects, help identify potential agencies and make the ride a little less bumpy.\n\n---\n\n**We're having issues with quality**\n\nUnderstanding how you specify what needs to be built and how you build that is key to understanding quality as a non-functional attribute.

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\n![](../cto.png)\n\n\n#### CTO Services\n\n###### What do you do?\n\nIt depends on the company and problems, but in summary:\n\n* Grow startups from seed to series A, B and beyond\n* Stabilise teams and businesses when communication has broken down or key people have left\n* Product discovery, development and helping companies with product & technology roadmaps and execution\n* Architect, design and develop applications with the teams\n\n###### How do you start with a company?\n\nI normally carry out discovery over three to five days and write a report on product, process and people with an aim to transform the business depending on the problems.  I'll work closely with teams and work hands-on with engineers, devops, product, QA and the wider business.\n\n###### How do you work in an interim capacity?\n\nI typically work in one interim role at a time.  That involves three to four days working with companies and their product/engineering teams on-site predominantly.  I use my other day for fractional work and startup advisory.\n\n--- \n\n###### How do you work in a fractional capacity?\n\nThis might involve one day a week or a few days a month depending on the problems the company is trying to solve.  I usually work with existing teams, analyse specific problems, set goals and coach teams towards those.  This is on-site.\n\n--- \n\n###### Why do I need a CTO?\n\nThe role of the CTO is often confusing and very different depending on the stage of company. There's a good article by McKinsey consulting on the subject - [Why you need a CTO](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/why-you-need-a-cto-and-how-to-make-her-successful)\n\n---\n\n###### How is it different to a head of/VP of engineering?\n\nI believe that CTO's at a point in their career in a company make a choice - either to remain hands on/technical or to move more into a people management/product strategy role - [Defining Roles - CTO and/or VP of Engineering](https://medium.com/engineering-leadership/defining-roles-cto-and-or-vp-engineering-f1c7563643a3)\n\n--- \n\n###### What problems do you work on?\n\nI've worked with the following problem areas, but please get in contact if you have something other than this.\n\n---\n**My CTO/lead engineer is leaving**\n\nIn the unfortunate situation whereby your most senior product/tech is leaving I can help with bridging the gap until you find the next person.  In some situations it's necessary to understand why they have left and solve the root cause or set of problems that led to the situation.  \n\n--- \n\n**\"I need to build a team in-house to build out the product\"**\n\nI can help with building a product and engineering team from the very beginning of the company journey.  I help founders find the right product/tech people and also advise on when the right time is to bring in specific roles to the business, including a CTO, VP/head of engineering, devops engineers etc..\n\n--- \n\n**I need to bring a product in-house from an agency**\n\nIt's great having an agency build out a product for you, but there are lots of questions that should be asked prior to the build of a product.  There are also key checkpoints and ways to ensure you build a scalable product or platform from the beginning, rather than it being an after-thought.  I can help with the rescue of products/software when things have gone awry, I can also help put a team around the product when you bring it in-house.\n\n--- \n\n**I need to grow my team, but not sure how to do this effectively**\n\nBuilding product/engineering teams for companies can be hard, especially if you just have engineers who need help with identifying gaps, weakenesses and strengths. I help by providing support here.  I can also carry out a review of the team and propose hiring plans.  I can also help with team structure (where it's needed) and where it compliments the product/platform you're building.\n\n--- \n\n**I think my team need help**\n\nYour team might have told you directly or you might sense this based on problems in the day to day running of the business.

I've built several distributed systems/micro-services products with Java/Python/Javascript/PHP.\n\n**Application Design for the Cloud** - http://tiny.cc/ef20ez\nPresentation I gave in Cardiff on how to architect applications for the cloud, mostly AWS.\n\n**The Role of the Architect** - https://www.slideshare.net/jph98/the-role-of-the-architect\nGave this presentation in Berlin at a meetup discussing the role of the architect in software teams (not the title).\n\n**Software Estimation Workshop** - http://tiny.cc/3r20ez\nA workshop I held internally at a company to improve the process of software estimates provided to the business.  Short story - use PERT, consider the whole\n\n**SOLID Principles for Object Oriented Design** - http://tiny.cc/mt30ez\nAn internal talk on using SOLID for good OO design in applications.  Big proponent for clean code by Michael Feathers and many years dealing with hideous legacy systems.  There be dragons.\n\n#### On Software Processes\n\nI have lots of experience reviewing product and engineering processes for companies and techniques around software development.  I generally approach changes to these as experiments putting in appropriate change management processes.\n\n**Debugging Software** - http://tiny.cc/5720ez\nInternal talk I gave after reading the brilliant book Debug It by Paul Butcher.  Still use the techniques to this day.\n\n**Refactoring** - http://tiny.cc/1h30ez\nInternal workshop I ran on refactoring principles and techniques for software (Java and statically typed language focused).\n\n**Jenkins and Continuous Integration** - http://tiny.cc/qj30ez\nInternal talk on using Jenkins (old now) for continuous integration circa 2011.\n\n#### On Hiring \n\nI have a popular hiring post on Linkedin, focused around some pretty dreary days in \n[Berlin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/berlin-jobs-some-hiring-advice-jonathan-holloway/)\n\n#### On Data Engineering and Science\n\nI've reviewed many data-intensive applications that utilise predictive analytics.  This ranges from drug-modelling applications to the review of data lakes and architectures for companies.  I've also been drafted in as a consultant to advise on specific data storage, pipeline and processing technology.\n\n**An Overview of Data Pipelines** - http://tiny.cc/ww20ez\nPresentation I gave at the South West JVM meetup on data pipelines of various descriptions (programmatic, configurable, visual).  This was before the days of Airflow, BEAM etc...\n\n**Introduction to Hadoop** - http://tiny.cc/b120ez\nAn old introduction to Hadoop I gave at a company off the back of a big Hadoop project.  \n\n**Hadoop and Pig** - http://tiny.cc/m830ez\nA set of presentations I gave internally at a company who were looking to do more with big data processing (past the use of R as a language).  This was after a big Hadoop project for a PB sized product.\n\n**MongoDB, MongoMapper and Ruby** - http://tiny.cc/lv30ez\nOn the use of (beautiful) Ruby, MongoMapper and MongoDB which I was using at the time to build an application performance framework tool.  Also used it to do performance and load testing for big drug discovery platforms.\n\n#### On Java\n\nI have deep experience of the JVM and associated languages (mostly Kotlin these days and have spoken at several events.\n\n**Introduction to JVM languages and Phantom** - http://tiny.cc/fy20ez\nGave this at South West JVM on a little known language called Phantom and the general approach to using alternatives to Java on the JVM\n\n**Spring Boot - An Introduction** - https://www.slideshare.net/jph98/spring-boot-an-introduction-59458065\nOK.  Flask came first in Python and even then I picked up Apache CXF and Dropwizard before Spring Boot came on the scene.  Used it to build a whole bunch of micro-services for various companies (and learned lots in the process).  Still use it to this day, but only with Kotlin.  \n\n#### Application Frameworks\n\nIn the past I've adopted and used an embarassing number of web frameworks across Java, PHP, Python, Ruby and Javascript.  I've also made use of various application frameworks for service-based applications.\n\n**Snow, A Micro Web Framework** - http://tiny.cc/6m30ez\nSouth West JVM talk I gave on a Java micro web framework called Snow.  This was after discovering Flask in the Python world a few years earlier and being blown away by the simplicty after coming from Java webapp land,.\n\n**High Performance Webapps** - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17BLkO19PVNNagU5JpBlb1TKFD1TgEoqGR3eIAWTgXos/edit#slide=id.p\nAn overiew of high performance webapps which came from much tuning of Apache workers (MPM/prefork) in-line with Tomcat and Java backend services.  Learned a lot about Linux from this, but mostly irrelevant in the world of auto-scaling on AWS etc...\n\n**Introduction to the Play Framework** - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tYh-YAotbk1jyEw3dGiKm0Hj7QbvV6k6m8yU_vrbiIY/edit#slide=id.gd0fde28c_098\nAn overview of the then trendy Play Framework before they moved to Scala and everybody hated it.  Shame.\n\n**Lightweight Web Frameworks, Flask** - https://www.slideshare.net/jph98/lightweight-web-frameworks\nAn overview of lighweight web frameworks (when I fell in love in Flask) and the alternatives in different technology ecosystems.  \n\n#### On Testing\n\nI have a fair bit of understanding on application testability, the use of various tools for unit, integration, acceptance and performance testing and when to adopt mocking frameworks to simplify testing for applications and micro-service based architectures.\n\n**Mockito, An Introduction** - http://tiny.cc/ro30ez\nInternal talk I gave on a mocking framework called Mockito.  The principles still apply using things such as Mocha/Chai etc... today.\n\n**What makes a good test?** - http://tiny.cc/3r30ez\nThe attributes of large, mid and small tests in applications.  Still applicable, people still getting it very wrong as well.  I see no tests, I see restrictive time-sucking useless test suites and aim for something in-between.\n\n**A TDD Kata** - http://tiny.cc/nz30ez\nA TDD kata I ran internally to improve our approach to test.  Not the biggest fan of TDD, bigger fan of good tests!\n\n#### On Devops and Technology\n\nI've spent a fair bit of time learning Linux system administration, provisioning, monitoring and performance technology.  \n\n**Application Monitoring** - http://tiny.cc/o530ez\nAn overview of monitoring apps at various different levels.  Gave this internally at Brightpearl when I worked there.  \n\n**Cloudinit/Userdata** - https://medium.com/@jonathan.holloway/simple-provisioning-of-ec2-instances-with-cloudinit-and-userdata-16b42edc512f\nA super simple way to provision EC2 instances on AWS.

I'm def. a fan of Terraform these days.\n\n**Database Migration with Flyway** - http://tiny.cc/e930ez\nAn overview of database migration after discovering an application that had been using Hibernate auto generated schema mappings.  Switched over to this after this.\n\n**Apache Ivy** - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hHndCJMVQ95npgZx8rxdsT73UtULi0tSi2LUzTxWxaw/edit#slide=id.i5\nOverview of Apache Ivy for dependency management.  Still prefer Maven massively and ended up writing all kinds of plugins around it at the time for a company hot on auditability in the pharma industry.\n\n#### On Music\n\nMy side-projects and hobbies revolve around music, gaming and building simulations (think Conways Game of Life etc...).  I'm a big fan of Unity, Phaser and Pixi.js here as well as Sonic Pi, Ableton for algorave and programmatic music generation.\n\n**MIDI and Java** - http://tiny.cc/9p30ez\nSide project of mine at the time looking at visual manipulation of MIDI and external hardware synthesizers.\n\n**Sonic Pi** - https://medium.com/@jonathan.holloway/sonic-pi-introduction-part-one-e2f12e9611df\nFirst of a multi-part series on using Sonic Pi (and Ruby) for generating music.  This is very much towards the algorave scene which I discovered after this.  \n§   \n#### Misc\n\n**Google Guava** - http://tiny.cc/7x30ez\nOld presentation on the use of Guava in Java to cleanup applications and prevnt boilerplate code writing.\n\n**General Purpose Languages (R, Python)** - http://tiny.cc/me40ez\nAn overview of general purpose language as an alternative to using R and Java at a company.  We setlled on Python, I ended up writing a lot of wrapper scripts around Perl Speaks NONMEM (PsN) at the time.  Good choice, was testable and better than hideous, hideous Bash scripts.  Watched in horror as someone wrote an early version of Chef, in Bash...",

Not the biggest fan of TDD, bigger fan of good tests!\n\n#### On Devops and Technology\n\nI've spent a fair bit of time learning Linux system administration, provisioning, monitoring and performance technology.  \n\n**Application Monitoring** - http://tiny.cc/o530ez\nAn overview of monitoring apps at various different levels.  Gave this internally at Brightpearl when I worked there.  \n\n**Cloudinit/Userdata** - https://medium.com/@jonathan.holloway/simple-provisioning-of-ec2-instances-with-cloudinit-and-userdata-16b42edc512f\nA super simple way to provision EC2 instances on AWS.  I was in a hurry at the time.  I'm def. a fan of Terraform these days.\n\n**Database Migration with Flyway** - http://tiny.cc/e930ez\nAn overview of database migration after discovering an application that had been using Hibernate auto generated schema mappings.  Switched over to this after this.\n\n**Apache Ivy** - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hHndCJMVQ95npgZx8rxdsT73UtULi0tSi2LUzTxWxaw/edit#slide=id.i5\nOverview of Apache Ivy for dependency management.  Still prefer Maven massively and ended up writing all kinds of plugins around it at the time for a company hot on auditability in the pharma industry.\n\n#### On Music\n\nMy side-projects and hobbies revolve around music, gaming and building simulations (think Conways Game of Life etc...).  I'm a big fan of Unity, Phaser and Pixi.js here as well as Sonic Pi, Ableton for algorave and programmatic music generation.\n\n**MIDI and Java** - http://tiny.cc/9p30ez\nSide project of mine at the time looking at visual manipulation of MIDI and external hardware synthesizers.\n\n**Sonic Pi** - https://medium.com/@jonathan.holloway/sonic-pi-introduction-part-one-e2f12e9611df\nFirst of a multi-part series on using Sonic Pi (and Ruby) for generating music.  This is very much towards the algorave scene which I discovered after this.  \n§   \n#### Misc\n\n**Google Guava** - http://tiny.cc/7x30ez\nOld presentation on the use of Guava in Java to cleanup applications and prevnt boilerplate code writing.\n\n**General Purpose Languages (R, Python)** - http://tiny.cc/me40ez\nAn overview of general purpose language as an alternative to using R and Java at a company.  We setlled on Python, I ended up writing a lot of wrapper scripts around Perl Speaks NONMEM (PsN) at the time.  Good choice, was testable and better than hideous, hideous Bash scripts.  Watched in horror as someone wrote an early version of Chef, in Bash...",
