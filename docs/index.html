<div class='introtext'>
I’m a founder/co-founder, product engineer. I work with deep-tech companies to build products.

I work with companies through a consulting company (HWIntegral) as an interim/fractional CTO which you can visit here.

<h1 class='sectiontitle'>Background and Career</h1>

<div class='contenttext'>
I started programming in 1994 with Turbo Pascal and Delphi on IBM 386/486, followed by Java, Ruby, Python, Javascript.
</div>
<div class='contenttext'>
Education wise, I studied Software Engineering @ Aberystwyth University (there were less than five universities in the UK that offered this course in 1998).  After graduation I co-founded my first company and started a PhD.  I left in 2003 with an MEng and MPhil and some journey towards CEng status with the BCS.  Going back to finish the PhD is the last thing on my mind currently : ) 
</div>
<div class='contenttext'>
Circa 2003 I’d had enough of academia and the beach (possibly not the beach) and started my commercial career building out applications and integrations with the now defunct Flybe.  At the time that meant integration with a 6 bit TPF reservation system called EDS shares and dealing with all the intricacies that came with it using Java, Spring, Oracle and Swing.  With a team of 15 or so engineers we put in ticketing robots, payment systems integration, online seat reservation, customer accounts and overhauled a lot of the on-premise hardware and infrastructure that supported the main booking engine.  
</div>
<div class='contenttext'>
After nearly four years I left to move to Vancouver, BC and spent several years as an engineer working on solving problems around search, indexing and analytics within the fintech industry using Java and Python.
</div>
<div class='contenttext'>
Next up I spent three years in the consulting world building out drug modelling, reporting and analytics solutions for Merck, Bayer, J&J and most of the pharmaceutical companies.  Most of the work was Java, Python and Javascript based.  There was some cool projects around drug model versioning and development, execution of NONMEM, PsN, SAS, R  and Matlab scripts/models on large distributed 1000 node grids using Sun/Oracle Grid Engine and cloud bursting (when the cloud came into fashion).  Mixture of engineering, technical, solutions architecture and pre-sales, it was interesting, but somewhat tiring.
</div>
<div class='contenttext'>
After that I moved back to the startup space working with several companies as a (Chief) Architect and CTO building out Java, PHP, Ruby, Python solutions at scale (1600 businesses) and working out why legacy applications are much fun.  I saw a company from Series B to Series D and wondered what happened in Seed and Series A.  The main lessons learned were:
Feature-factories never ever work - you’re just throwing mud against the wall and seeing what sticks;
</div>
<div class='contenttext'>
As a CTO you ultimately, have to have product and engineering under one executive in terms of objectives, measurement and success.  
</div>
<div class='contenttext'>
After a disastrous and horrendous year @ a company in Berlin (I shipped the first product in six weeks I might add) I decided to stick with the startup space, but moved to London instead.  
</div>
<div class='contenttext'>
I also focused efforts on taking my part-time product manager that that I’d worn for many years (initial startup, Berlin startup, business architecture and consulting job) and transitioned to a full-time product manager to help the Seed funded (and Series A companies) with their product ideas.
I minimised the risk of doing the startup thing at seed/Series A level by founding a company to do interim/fractional CTO work to help people/companies with funding, building and growing teams based on the experience earlier in my career.  I’ve helped 20+ companies with various problems (mass walk-outs, I have no tech team, my product is screwed, I have this great idea…, why is my team doing this).  Four plus years and counting
</div>
<div class='contenttext'>
This is sufficient, but it’s also a a way of finding the right, next business/product whilst avoiding the problems that come with startups (inexperienced founders, completely shot platforms/software with no way to recover, politics and bullshit in organisations that are non-fixable).  
</div>
<div class='contenttext'>
Transparency and trust are everything.  Respect for engineers and engineering is paramount. 
</div>
<div class='title'>
If you’re looking for a co-founder, for a deep-tech or B2B startup (Series A min) then get in-touch.
