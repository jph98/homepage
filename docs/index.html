        <p class="white-text">
        I started programming in 1994 with Turbo Pascal and Delphi on IBM 386/486, followed by Java, Ruby, Python, Javascript.  
        <br><br>
        Education wise, I studied Software Engineering @ Aberystwyth University (there were less than 
        five universities in the UK that offered this course in 1998).  After graduation I co-founded 
        my first company and started a PhD.  I left in 2003 with an MEng in Software Engineering, 
        an MPhil postgrad and an attempt at co-founding a startup (it did ok, by todays standards).  
        That included raising money, building the product and selling to academic institutions.
        <br><br>
        Circa 2003 I’d had enough of academia and the beach (possibly not the beach) and started my 
        commercial career building out applications and integrations with the now defunct Flybe.  
        At the time that meant integration with a 6 bit TPF reservation system called EDS shares 
        and dealing with all the intricacies that came with it using Java, Spring, Oracle and Swing.  
        With a team of 15 or so engineers we put in ticketing robots, payment systems integration, 
        online seat reservation, customer accounts and overhauled a lot of the on-premise hardware 
        and infrastructure that supported the main booking engine.      
        <br><br>
        After nearly four years I left to move to Vancouver, BC and spent several years as an engineer 
        working on solving problems around search, indexing and analytics within the fintech industry 
        using Java and Python.  This involved building big Java/Spring services, a financial messaging 
        platform and finally a distributed indexing platform using some real PITA technologies.  I moved
        back to the UK at this time, spent six months working remotely before leaving to find something
        closer to this side of the ocean.    
        <br><br>
        Next up I spent three years in the consulting world building out drug modelling, 
        reporting and analytics solutions for Merck, Bayer, J&J and most of the pharmaceutical 
        companies.  Most of the work was Java, Python and Javascript based.  
        There were some interesting projects around drug model versioning and development, execution 
        of NONMEM, PsN, SAS, R  and Matlab scripts/models on large distributed 1000 node grids 
        using Sun/Oracle Grid Engine and cloud bursting (when the cloud came into fashion).  
        Mixture of engineering, technical, solutions architecture and pre-sales.  I really broke the Java 
        train at this point and ventured out into Python and R for solutions.  Breath of fresh air and unshackling 
        of the JVM chains was a godsend.
        <br><br>
        I moved back to the startup space, a little later on this time around Series A/B working with a company as 
        an engineer/architect.  This was a big PHP monolith that had been rearchited on the backend onto a wonky Java micro-services
        platform. This was the first big C-level strategy, re-platform, develop products role - learned a lot about what works and what
        doesn't.  Built a mobile Point of Sale solution with Swift and Spring Boot with the Netflix stack. 
        We had over 1600 businesses running on the platform with a mixture of Java, PHP, Ruby, Python solutions on AWS.
        I saw a company through two major funding rounds, learned lots, had lots of fun, but decided I wanted to be more hands on
        with an earlier stage company I could shape.  The main lessons learned were:
        <br><br>
        - You need both product and engineering reporting into you - objectives/platform health and success;
        <br>
        - Feature-factories never ever work - you’re just throwing mud against the wall and seeing what sticks;
        <br>
        - If you ignore legacy code, eventually it catches up with you, like treacle and impedes you commercially.
        <br><br>
        Making a startup work is easy right?  What about in a different country? : ) I moved out to Berlin. 
        That turned out to be a total disaster of a company, and we were doomed from the outset.  I stuck with it, 
        I should have quit there and then.  Second version of the product, too much minimal techno and far too many 
        painful conversations with inexperienced co-founders, I called it a day.  I saw part of the insolvency process
        with the lawyers, learned a lot about "trust and transparency" as well. I wanted to stay, but the German attitude
        towards c-level execs being German meant it was very tough to find a role.  I eventually founded a role with
        BCGDV, but turned down a 130k offer to return home for personal and family reasons. If you're ever thinking
        of making the move, I'll happily speak to you about it in an honest manner.                    
        <br><br>
        From there on in I decided to minimise the risk in doing the startup "dance" "as a consultant.  I setup my own
        limited company with a partner and decided to do technology consulting and interim CTO work for seed, series A, B
        companies.
        <br><br>
        Lots of the companies are broken in different ways, some are fixable, some aren't.  Following the boyscout rule
        of always leaving things in a better state than what you found them is core.  Pleasing founders isn't always possible.
        <br><br>
        Most of my early stage work is a mixture of product management, technology strategy, organising people and a lot of
        architecture and applying more grown-up practices in a pragmatic manner.                
        <br><br>
        I’ve helped 20+ companies with various problems (mass walk-outs, I have no tech team, 
        my product is iffy, I have this great idea, why is my team doing this etc..)  
        <br><br>
        I'm looking for the next thing, whether that's interim or perm CTPO.  Message me if you want to chat.
