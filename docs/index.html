        <p class="white-text">
        I started programming in 1994 with Turbo Pascal and Delphi on IBM 386/486, followed by Java, Ruby, Python, Javascript.  
        <br><br>
        Education wise, I studied Software Engineering @ Aberystwyth University (there were less than 
        five universities in the UK that offered this course in 1998).  After graduation I co-founded 
        my first company and started a PhD.  I left in 2003 with an MEng in Software Engineering, 
        an MPhil postgrad and an attempt at co-founding a startup (it did ok, by todays standards).  
        That included raising money, building the product and selling to academic institutions.
        <br><br>
        Circa 2003 I’d had enough of academia and the beach (possibly not the beach) and started my 
        commercial career building out applications and integrations with the now defunct Flybe.  
        At the time that meant integration with a 6 bit TPF reservation system called EDS shares 
        and dealing with all the intricacies that came with it using Java, Spring, Oracle and Swing.  
        With a team of 15 or so engineers we put in ticketing robots, payment systems integration, 
        online seat reservation, customer accounts and overhauled a lot of the on-premise hardware 
        and infrastructure that supported the main booking engine.      
        <br><br>
        After nearly four years I left to move to Vancouver, BC and spent several years as an engineer 
        working on solving problems around search, indexing and analytics within the fintech industry 
        using Java and Python.  This involved building big Java/Spring services, a financial messaging 
        platform and finally a distributed indexing platform using some real PITA technologies.  I moved
        back to the UK at this time, spent six months working remotely before leaving to find something
        closer to this side of the ocean.    
        <br><br>
        Next up I spent three years in the consulting world building out drug modelling, 
        reporting and analytics solutions for Merck, Bayer, J&J and most of the pharmaceutical 
        companies.  Most of the work was Java, Python and Javascript based.  
        There was some cool projects around drug model versioning and development, execution 
        of NONMEM, PsN, SAS, R  and Matlab scripts/models on large distributed 1000 node grids 
        using Sun/Oracle Grid Engine and cloud bursting (when the cloud came into fashion).  
        Mixture of engineering, technical, solutions architecture and pre-sales, it was interesting, 
        but somewhat tiring.    
        <br><br>
        After that I moved back to the startup space working with several companies as a (Chief) 
        Architect and CTO building out Java, PHP, Ruby, Python solutions at scale (1600 businesses)
        and working out why legacy applications are much fun.  I saw a company from Series B to 
        Series D and wondered what happened in Seed and Series A.  The main lessons learned were:
        <br><br>
        - You need both product and engineering reporting into you - objectives/platform health and success;
        <br>
        - Feature-factories never ever work - you’re just throwing mud against the wall and seeing what sticks;
        <br>
        - If you ignore legacy code, eventually it catches up with you, like treacle and impedes you commercially.
        <br><br>
        Making a startup work is easy right?  What about in a different company?: ) I moved to Berlin. 
        That turned out to be a total disaster from the very start, although I did pickup a penchant for minimal techno.
        What I signed up for I did not inherit on day one.  One year of painful conversations, 
        co-founder education and blowing money we didn't have on silly SEO campaigns I 
        called it a day.  After looking for another job and turning down a 130k job with BCGDV in 
        Berlin I moved back to the UK and London specifically.  Moral of the story - don't expect 
        to get another c-level job, unless you speak the language, or are German.  BCGDV was very different.
        <br><br>
        I decided to minimise risk by doing the startup thing as a consultant, starting once again 
        with seed, but also picking up series A, B companies.  I founded a company to do interim/fractional CTO work 
        Most of them are broken in different ways, some people are appreciative, some people have 
        unrealistic expectations.  Some people are just sheer narcicists.  Lots of the work is a 
        mixture of product management, technology strategy, people skills and definitely a lot 
        more hands on coding, design and architecture. I supplemented this with training on the 
        side (product management, CTO coaching), several side projects in the mobile space and
        building a startup.
        <br><br>
        I’ve helped 20+ companies with various problems (mass walk-outs, I have no tech team, 
        my product is screwed, I have this great idea, why is my team doing this).
